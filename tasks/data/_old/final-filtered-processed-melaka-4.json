From the moment I stepped in, the staff were so calm, gentle, and professional. Even when I was crying and panicking during the procedure (yes, I really did 😭), they stayed so patient and understanding. The nurse even let me hold her hand the whole time — that small gesture really meant a lot to me.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was how caring and reassuring everyone was. They didn’t rush anything, they explained every step clearly, and they made sure I was comfortable from start to finish. After the procedure, they took their time to explain in detail how to take care of the wound, what I should and shouldn’t do, and what to expect during recovery.\n\nYou can really tell they care about their patients, not just during the treatment but also after it. I feel so grateful I found this clinic — truly one of the best dental experiences I’ve ever had. If you’re nervous about dental treatments, this is the place to go. 💯🦷❤️",

You waited for 1-2 month for an appointment? Wrong! Wait another additional month.\n\nMany more bad reviews in their google page they only seen.\n\nHopefully, they can improve their appointment system and upscaling since there are many work in progress.
