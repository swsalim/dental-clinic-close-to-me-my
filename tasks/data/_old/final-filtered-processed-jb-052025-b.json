Dr. Wong clearly takes pride in her work and made sure everything was done with great care. I also appreciate that her clinic maintains very reasonable rates even with the latest equipment.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dentist who’s skilled, kind, and honest, I highly recommend Dr. Wong Dental.

Was very impressed by the professional and calm treatment provided by Dr Wong.\n\nThe session started with checking the condition of my teeth, which she demonstrated to me with live video/photo, which I was surprised to see! She then clearly explained what follow-up treatment she recommended in future. During the scaling and polishing, she also clearly explained each step, and also assured me that I could stop the treatment at any time if too painful. Dr Wong and her assistant were very patient and kind throughout the session.\n\nWill definitely recommend and be returning myself! A very positive experience! 🙏🏻",
