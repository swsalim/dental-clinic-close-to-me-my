Her professional advice and suggestions were logical and practical—unlike a dental center in SS14 that tried to convince me to undergo various treatments that may not be effective.\n\nDue to certain circumstances, the affected tooth could not be extracted during my first visit, and I had to return the next day.\n\nOn the following day, Dr. Grace followed up on my case. She patiently explained the extraction procedure & condition. After several attempts and numbers of doses of anesthetic, my affected tooth was finally extracted—without much pain. I am extremely happy, relief and satisfied, especially after suffering from tooth pain for a week, which greatly affected my daily life.\n\nThank you, Dr. Grace, for the excellent work, and thank you, Dr. Ashley, for providing such an effective and honest solution!",

I shall not mention name but will refer this as \"1st dentist\".\n\nFrom the start, the treatment to fill up 2 cavities on 2 adjoining molar wasn't within my expectation. Food constantly being lodged between the 2 teeth after the treatment... and in less than 2 months, I've decided to visit a different dentist, Dr Grace Chan who did a marvellous job in rectifying the problem by redoing the filling to one of the 2 teeth. Job well done! 5⭐️\n\nToday I visited Dr Grace Chan again thinking either one of the two fillings done was chipped off while chewing on my food a week earlier. Alas! The part affected was the filling done by the 1st dentist. Again, Dr Grace did a fantastic job and fingers crossed, I don't have to return to the clinic for the initial crappy job done by the 1st 1⭐️ dentist\n\nI'll return again but only for Dr Grace.",

Initially i came for check up and cleansing of my teeth.\nAs the lady dentist pointed out that two of my molar teeth need filling so i had my fillings done right after the cleansing.\nShe did a white filling for me, in total i was charged rm400 plus (100pls for cleansing and the rest for fillings).\nHowever the fillings was not done well, so i had discomfort after a few days and came back to the clinic a week after, met another lady dentist who said the dentist who did for me was not available on that day. She offered redo the fillings but i refused as I already suffered a lot mentally besides that they knew my medical condition before giving me treatment that my body cannot take stress.\nI am very disappointed over the skills of this practice.I am aware all the dentists at this practice are ladies and those two I met are young, they are not over 35 of age, i m a lady in her mid fifties and i believe i am a good judge of other ladies' age.\nFor yr infor, the fillings all came off after a few weeks, so is my money and suffering i endure during the filling sessions.",

Concerned, I sought a second opinion at a nearby dental clinic.\n\nTo my dismay, the new dentist revealed that the filling at Tiew Dental Bandar Puteri was improperly done, leaving the root exposed and resulting in an infection. As a consequence, I now need a root canal treatment to salvage the tooth, which could have been avoided had the initial procedure been performed correctly.\n\nI am very disappointed with the level of care I received at Tiew Dental by Gan Wei Chien.

This is not reasonable.\n\nOther thing to comment is the helper that hold the suction during the treatment, they done really see and pay attention. Most of the time it is sucking at your skin rather than the water. You try it then you know what I am saying.\n\nThis type of staff should be sacked. The dentist is ok but with this type of staff, I won't recommend to go there.",

I ended up with extra hole in my tooth and procedure not done. This bad service dragged my tooth pain problem further.\n2. I was always on time for my appointments.

Despite my efforts to book in advance, I frequently face long waiting times and delays. The front desk staff assured me they would inform me of my appointment time, but after waiting for three weeks without any update, I had to follow up myself. This lack of communication is highly unprofessional and frustrating. I schedule appointments for my convenience, not for the convenience of your clinic, and I expect better service.\nSecondly, when I have an issue with my braces, I am required to wait for my assigned doctor to return, even though I have explicitly stated that any available doctor could assist me. This rigid system leads to unnecessary delays in my treatment, which is unacceptable.\nMoreover, I do not understand how such a large and well-established dental clinic lacks the necessary tools for treatment. On multiple occasions, I have been told that certain tools were unavailable, causing further delays. This is highly concerning and raises questions about the clinic’s preparedness and efficiency.",
