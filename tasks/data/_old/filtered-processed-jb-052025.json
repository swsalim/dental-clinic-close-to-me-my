When I first came to him, I was dealing with constant jaw pain, and it was really affecting my day-to-day life.\n\nDr. Chong was patient and thorough, taking the time to explain everything and make sure I understood my options. The Invisalign treatment not only straightened my teeth but also eased my jaw pain significantly. I can’t believe how much better I feel now.\n\nAfter that, he did my implants and onlays, and they look and feel so natural. I was a bit nervous about the procedures, but Dr. Chong made the whole experience smooth and comfortable. He always made sure I felt at ease and answered any questions I had.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Dr. Chong is how much he genuinely cares. He’s not just fixing teeth — he’s improving people’s lives. I’m so much happier with my smile now, and the pain relief has been life-changing.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dentist who’s skilled, caring, and trustworthy, I highly recommend Dr. Chong. I couldn’t be happier with my experience!",

After my orthodontic treatment was completed, she insisted on selling me additional, unnecessary procedures to \"enlarge\" four of my front teeth. She even suggested replacing my perfectly healthy teeth with crowns for purely aesthetic reasons.\n\nBack then, I didn’t know what a crown was (I was 23 y/o at the time), and when I asked her if the procedure would cost extra, she blatantly lied to me and said no. By the time it was too late—when my teeth had already been filed down and fitted with temporary crowns—I was slapped with a hefty bill for the crowns!\n\nThis happened back in 2016, and I’m leaving this review today because not a single day goes by without me regretting replacing my completely healthy teeth with crowns at this clinic. The dentist didn’t explain what the procedure would entail, and now I’m stuck with this decision for the rest of my life, ruining my teeth in the long term.\n\nFor others who are visiting this dental clinic, I’m not sure if the dentist who worked on my teeth still works here, but please get a second opinion on whatever treatment they’re offering you before irreversible damage is done.",

I was attended by two separate doctors: Dr. Chow for the root canal and Dr. Dewi for the crown.\n\nBoth were very professional throughout my treatment. The staff were friendly and attentive to my needs.\n\nThe clinic is also conveniently located about 6 minutes away from JB Sentral.\n\nIf you're looking for dental services, I highly recommend J Dental. 😊😊👍",

I came all the way from Singapore and requested to get 4 fillings done in one shot :))) something not many clinics would agree to. But Dr. Taqi was incredibly understanding and accommodating, knowing my situation.\n\nFrom the start, all my enquiries were answered clearly and respectfully. I even asked to see examples of the dentures I was planning to get, and both Dr. Taqi and the nurses were super helpful and patient in showing me everything I needed to know.\n\nThe front desk ladies were also really friendly and approachable, which made the whole experience even more pleasant. And the best part? The waiting time was almost nonexistent, I handed over my IC and within a minute, I was already being called in. Everything went so smoothly from start to finish.\n\nHighly recommend this clinic! Thank you to the whole team for making my visit such a positive one. 🫶",

Ok maybe we see wrongly / they are here for emergencies.. but they just ask us to wait and didn’t want to say anything else. Alamak. We decided to forgo our appointments.\n\nBut I’d say.. their rates are 1 of the cheapest in jb.. n they had a high google rating (which was why we went over.. ).

Explaining every step and the rationale behind it. Felt like i was having a dentistry lecture HAHA i'm glad that she did which makes me more aware of my oral health and the treatment process.\n\nwhat i like the most is that the procedure is gentle and painless. Which overcome the stigma i have whenever i go for a dental check up.\n\nThe nurses team was attentive and informative as well. Prompt response on whatsapp and able to answer all my queries.\n\nOverall, plesant experience and worthy of this 5 stars review. Thank you!",

        "text": "Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Dental Treatment and Service Experience\n\nTo Prodental Specialists Group,\n\nI am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment regarding the treatment and service I have received at your clinic.\n\nWhen I first visited your clinic, I came prepared with a referral letter and X-rays from another clinic. My main concern was to get braces, and I was hoping for a clear treatment plan and guidance. However, I was advised by Dr. [Name] to begin by treating my gum disease before proceeding with braces. Trusting your expertise, I followed the recommendation and began the treatment.\n\nTo date, I have spent over $4,000 and several months undergoing treatment, only to be told recently that I will need to wait another four months before a final decision can be made regarding braces. What’s more distressing is that during a consultation with the braces specialist, I was informed that the estimated cost of the full procedure—including retainers, consultations, scaling, and X-rays—would be approximately $20,000 to $25,000.\n\nHad this information been shared with me at the beginning—especially by the braces specialist—I would have had the opportunity to consider all my options, whether to continue treatment with your clinic or seek more affordable alternatives elsewhere. Despite the high cost, I chose to proceed because I trusted that I would receive professional care and see positive results. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.\n\nI want to make it clear that I have all recordings, videos, and receipts from day one until today as documentation of my entire experience. This situation has not only affected me financially but also caused me significant emotional stress. I feel misled and extremely disappointed.\n\nI hope you take this matter seriously and provide a clear explanation and resolution. If this issue is not addressed appropriately, I will have no choice but to consider further action.\n\nSincerely,\nKayalvizhi Amurthalingam",

Dr. Saw, the subject matter expert in this field, provided me with excellent advice and performed a deep cleaning for my gums. Before my visit, I struggled with swollen gums and frequent toothaches. Now, 6–7 months later, my gum health has improved tremendously and is in excellent condition.

Both Dr Lim Kiat Lin and Dr Saw Woon Ling were extremely professional and honest in assessing what they need to do. They examined and discussed and explained to me what and how they will carry out the implant surgery. They carried out the surgery so well that by the time I boarded the bus returning to Singapore the bleeding had stopped. They injected a localized\nanesthesia on my  lower gum before carrying out the surgery and I took only 1 pain killer tablet . I did not feel any pain at all after that. I will be going back to the dental clinic 3 months later for the crowning of my implants and the measurement for my dental bridge. I have since recommend several friends for dental treatment at the clinic",

She use all the ways to make my boy feel comfortable and managed to successfully complete the filling.\nIt definitely wasn’t easy, but Dr. Chong handled the situation with so much care and calmness.\n\nShe also took the time to explain to me what might happen if the condition worsens, which I really appreciated as a parent. It gave me a clearer understanding and peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience with Dr. Chong and would highly recommend her to any parents looking for a dentist who truly understands and cares for children.\nThank you, Dr. Chong, for your amazing work and compassion!",

I started my Invisalign journey with her, had both of my upper wisdom teeth extracted, and just completed a lower wisdom tooth surgery today—which took about 3 hours.\n\nThroughout the entire procedure, Dr. Jolene was incredibly kind, patient, and attentive. She constantly checked in to make sure I was okay, which really helped ease my nerves. Her professionalism and gentle approach have made every visit comfortable and reassuring.\n\nI’ve been recommending this clinic to my friends and colleagues whenever they’re looking for dental treatment in JB, and I’ll continue to do so. Thank you, Dr. Jolene and team, for always taking such good care of me!",

Dr. Jolene is, first and foremost, a polite and extremely transparent doctor. I appreciate the fact she's honest with her patients (as I think, in this day and age, that's a rare thing to find) & she isn't pushy about anything either. She's someone who truly puts in care in both her patients and clinic. And honestly, I'm looking forward to my next extraction because of the good experience(s) I had. I do believe it's because she understands my situation and takes extra care/time to make sure I'm doing okay (and gives me time to close my mouth or so if I need to).\n\nI appreciated her telling me to rest a bit when she saw me closing my jaw a little; it was a small yet impressionable gesture which I genuinely appreciated. :) I thank her nurses for being attentive and accommodating too!\n\nI think when you come across a clinic that not only looks good, but is well maintained and has staff that's been there a long time & most are still as bubbly, you can kinda guess the person running has their heart in their practice & doing their best. 💗 My mum and I are grateful to have found Pink & White Dental for sure. Looking forward to seeing Dr. Jolene again! God bless always!",

        "text": "I visited Asiaa Dental Clinic yesterday for a teeth whitening session, along with scaling, polishing, and an additional tooth filing procedure. My friend recommended me as she was quite pleased with their treatment. I was attended to by Dr Thasha, and I must say—I’m thoroughly impressed with both her and the team’s overall service and attitude.\n\nDr Thasha was patient and attentive, clearly explaining each step of the procedures beforehand. Throughout the session, she and the staff consistently checked in to ensure I was comfortable and doing well.\n\nDuring the second stage of the whitening treatment, I experienced an unexpected reaction—intense numbness and a burning sensation on my lips, which left me panicking as it was something I’d never felt before. The staff responded immediately, informing Dr Thasha, who attended to me promptly. She remained calm and professional, reassuring me that some patients may have such reactions when the lips come into contact with the chemical. She also explained that the severity of the reaction can vary between individuals. My lips were visibly swollen and appeared burned by the end of the session, but Dr Thasha comforted me that it will disappear after 1-2 days and reduced the duration for the final stage of the treatment to prevent further discomfort. She also told me to contact them if the condition doesn't improve.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the session, I experienced sudden and intense sharp pain in the bottom front row of my teeth. Dr Thasha checked in on me, and I informed her about the pain. She kindly provided ibuprofen, which helped relieve the pain slightly. I was also given fluoride mousse and a soothing gel for my teeth and lips to bring home for aftercare.\n\nWhat truly touched me was the follow-up—a WhatsApp message from the clinic the next day to check if I was feeling better. Their care and concern really stood out to me.\n\nWhile the reaction and pain I experienced were likely due to my naturally sensitive teeth, I am still very pleased with the service provided. I highly recommend Asiaa Dental Clinic for their professionalism, warm service, and affordable pricing. The location is also relatively close to KSL (about 10mins walk), although do note that certain part of the clinic is currently undergoing renovation.\n\nThank you Dr Thasha and the team :)",

That's new, you rarely find people open shop and say to walk in customers that they \"don't sell\" items that they actually have. Whoever hired this lady must hate having more business, because I proceeded to two clinics and they took the trouble to find me the items I want and they sold it to me, how nice ?!

Back then, I got stuck in a massive jam to JB and had to postpone my appointment last minute — they were so understanding and rescheduled it to a date that was super convenient for me without any hassle.\n\nJust yesterday, they impressed me again. I needed a last-minute appointment for both my in-laws to get extractions done. Despite the short notice, they managed to slot in an afternoon session at 2:30pm for both of them — which was already amazing service.\n\nWe accidentally went to the wrong dental clinic and had to rush over to theirs, arriving slightly late around 2:45pm. Thankfully, the staff were patient and kind enough to wait for us. After a smooth registration process, the doctor promptly called in my in-laws one after the other with no long waiting time.\n\nThe extractions were done very fast and efficiently. Both my in-laws came out with no pain and big smiles — they were genuinely happy with the experience. That kind of care and professionalism is hard to come by.\n\nI highly recommend S Smilings Dental to anyone looking for trustworthy, gentle, and accommodating dental care!",

I had severe toothache and sensitivity for months, even after a filling. The pain spread to other teeth, making it hard to enjoy simple things like a warm beverage in the cold mornings or cold drinks after running out in the sun without the sensitivity or nagging fear at the back of my mind.\n\nDr Fung listened attentively to my concerns and explained all possible scenarios that gave me confidence that made me feel truly involved in my own care.\n\nShe performed a CBCT scan on-site, found cracks causing the pain, and diligently removed them. Now, I can drink hot and cold beverages pain-free.\n\nHer expertise and genuine care about patiences’ well-being made all the difference—she not only fixed a piece of tooth but also a peace of mind.\n\nLast but not least, the assistant at the counter was very professional and attentive, even arrange for cab service to my next destination!",

Although it was not so much pain, she gave me injection and it went away, it was just for a fraction of secs.\nI must say, the clinic is fantastic, Dr. Ng Kai ling is amazing amazing. If you want RCt please close your eyes and go here.\nYou will not regret.\nThanks SG dental and Dr NG.. appreciate your work.",

The clinic is immaculately clean and well-maintained, which immediately gave me confidence that I was in good hands.\n\nDr. Lee’s professionalism, warmth, and expertise were evident throughout my treatment. She took the time to thoroughly understand my concerns, explain every step, and ensure I felt comfortable and informed.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the team’s dedication to post-treatment care. They followed up promptly to check on my recovery, showing genuine concern for my well-being — a level of care that’s rare to find. It’s clear that patient comfort and satisfaction are their top priorities.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dental clinic that combines skill, compassion, a spotless environment, and excellent follow-up care, SG Dental Clinic is the place to go.
