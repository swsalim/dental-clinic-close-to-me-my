        "text": "I visited Asiaa Dental Clinic yesterday for a teeth whitening session, along with scaling, polishing, and an additional tooth filing procedure. My friend recommended me as she was quite pleased with their treatment. I was attended to by Dr Thasha, and I must say—I’m thoroughly impressed with both her and the team’s overall service and attitude.\n\nDr Thasha was patient and attentive, clearly explaining each step of the procedures beforehand. Throughout the session, she and the staff consistently checked in to ensure I was comfortable and doing well.\n\nDuring the second stage of the whitening treatment, I experienced an unexpected reaction—intense numbness and a burning sensation on my lips, which left me panicking as it was something I’d never felt before. The staff responded immediately, informing Dr Thasha, who attended to me promptly. She remained calm and professional, reassuring me that some patients may have such reactions when the lips come into contact with the chemical. She also explained that the severity of the reaction can vary between individuals. My lips were visibly swollen and appeared burned by the end of the session, but Dr Thasha comforted me that it will disappear after 1-2 days and reduced the duration for the final stage of the treatment to prevent further discomfort. She also told me to contact them if the condition doesn't improve.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the session, I experienced sudden and intense sharp pain in the bottom front row of my teeth. Dr Thasha checked in on me, and I informed her about the pain. She kindly provided ibuprofen, which helped relieve the pain slightly. I was also given fluoride mousse and a soothing gel for my teeth and lips to bring home for aftercare.\n\nWhat truly touched me was the follow-up—a WhatsApp message from the clinic the next day to check if I was feeling better. Their care and concern really stood out to me.\n\nWhile the reaction and pain I experienced were likely due to my naturally sensitive teeth, I am still very pleased with the service provided. I highly recommend Asiaa Dental Clinic for their professionalism, warm service, and affordable pricing. The location is also relatively close to KSL (about 10mins walk), although do note that certain part of the clinic is currently undergoing renovation.\n\nThank you Dr Thasha and the team :)",
