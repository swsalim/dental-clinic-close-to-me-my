Saya tulis 3 kan?”\n\nPlain rude, one can only imagine how is she likes to others esp elders. To that particular nurse, if you can’t deal with people then don’t be in service industry. Too bad I didn’t got her name.\n\nService was quick though, almost too quick. Scaling took roughly 10mins or less. But hey, I only paid few Ringgit so what can I expect.",

Dr. Alex made it all happen within that short time, which was incredible. He is incredibly patient, knowledgeable, and takes the time to explain everything clearly — I felt really well cared for from start to finish.\n\nBig thanks to his lovely team as well — everyone from the front desk to the assistants was so warm and welcoming, which made all the difference.\n\nAlso a special shoutout to Dr. Joanne for painting a few temporary teeth on my clear aligners so I could still smile confidently while waiting for my crowns. Such a thoughtful touch!\n\nHighly recommend this clinic to anyone looking for professional, caring, and efficient dental care. Totally worth the trip!",

It seems that his focus has shifted from patient care to profit. I now believe he is frequently shuttling between Australia and KK, obsessing over converting Malaysian Ringgit to Australian Dollars, which suggests that financial gain has overtaken his commitment to ethical treatment. Please do not compared aussie dollar to RM and thinking is so cheap in KK. Our cost of living is different!\n\nDuring my most recent visit, he performed dental procedures without offering a proper explanation and even removed teeth without my informed consent. This breach of trust, after nearly 20 years of care, is not only disheartening but also unacceptable. There are many other capable and ethical dentists in KK who prioritize patients over profit, and I can no longer recommend his services.\n\nFurthermore, I ask that no response to my review claim a lack of patient records or insist that I come to the clinic to “work it out.” This feedback comes purely from a long-term patient and is not from a competitor. We are simply your patients, and we expect accountability for the care we receive.",

        "text": "I went to Luyang for scaling but they were fully booked until June 2026 so they recommended me to go here instead. The doctor gave me a check up, scaling & minor dental filling since it was a very small cavity & didn't require a lot of time to treat. Total cost was only RM5 with brief period of waiting. Just make sure you book an appointment beforehand on MySejahtera. The system resets every 10PM.\n\nAll of the staff were very nice & friendly & the clinic was air conditioned & comfortable too. Overall, a very satisfying experience. Next time I'll just come here for my dental appointments.",

Husband sy dtg sbb sakit gg hujg yg tumbuh tu sgt sakit smpai xdpt tidur. Buat appointment mysejahtera full sampai tiada tarikh yg available. So kita dtg walk-in. Staff lelaki tu cakap 'kami full ni, kami utamakan yg ada appt, kami cuma layan kes trauma dan emergency sahaja', lps tu ramai la yg dtg dan terus pulang xdpt rawatan. Ada yg marah2 lagi sbb anaknya xdpt rawatan. Husband sy, staff tu cakap kalau mahu masuk juga kena tunggu lama la sbb ramai tu tengah menunggu. Sy ckp dgn suami masuk saja. End up dalam tu tidak ramai pun.  Tidak crowded mcm yg diwar2kan staff lelaki tu. X smpai 30 minit husband dah siap rawatan, thank you doc but please manage the staff. Kesian la yg dtg tak dapat rawatan tu padahal tak ramai pun pt. Buktinya rawatan tak lama pun. Staff lelaki tua tu layan org2 tua pun tak ramah ya.",

I just wanna give my special thanks once again to Dr.Eddie and will definitely come back to get my teeth check. Thank you!",

Also, making appointment here is the same as not making appointment at all because they allow 1st come 1st serve, which ended up always making me wait for the walk in customers even when i arrive slightly earlier than my appointment time. Never coming here again.",

The price is very affordable with less than RM500 for removing my wisdom tooth. 👍🏻\nGod bless you all.\n\nI've been struggling with my wisdom tooth last month.\nBefore coming here, I went to another dentist and the pills they gave me were overdose, and to remove my wisdom tooth only, they quote me for RM1100+-, unless I pull out the front tooth as well, then total cost will be RM600+, but my other tooth was fine, just my wisdom tooth were doing terrible. Why would I wanna lose an extra tooth just for saving RM500？\n\nI felt that the first one I went was very unprofessional, so I Googled a few places, and straight away I made a decision and called here, I remember the nurse that picked up my call first she's very professional. She asked about my condition and gave me a professional advice, I was having a great pain that moment, but she told me I should finish the pill I was given from the first dentist and made me an appointment. Later that day, the doctor took her time, patiently helped me removed my bad tooth, and a lot of other advice and stuff were given to take care of my teeth.\nProfessionally done and even ask me to go back to check my tooth for free. One of the service best service I ever had in a very long time, thank you as much as I can say, very much. 🙏🏼",

He charges a RM60 consultation fee and gives various options of what is possible and his charges for each option. His analgesia is excellent. He is patient and will answer all your questions. If you have tricky/complex teeth problems, I would highly recommend him.",

        "text": "Our entire family visited this doctor after my daughter tested positive for Influenza A at a pediatric clinic two nights earlier, as we were all showing similar symptoms. Upon arrival, I informed the doctor about my daughter's Influenza A diagnosis and expressed concern that we might have contracted the same virus. However, the doctor dismissed this and insisted that we all had bacterial infections based on his observations. He also mentioned that the clinic did not have an Influenza test kit and proceeded to prescribe antibiotics for all of us.\nUnfortunately, this incorrect treatment (antibiotics instead of antivirals for Influenza A) had serious consequences. My mother-in-law experienced severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and difficulty walking due to low oxygen levels in her blood. We had to rush her to the hospital, where she was tested, confirmed to have Influenza A, admitted, and treated appropriately. The doctor at the hospital advised us to immediately stop taking all the medication prescribed by this clinic.\nWhile I understand that not all clinics stock Influenza test kits or antiviral medications, this does not justify prescribing incorrect treatments based solely on convenience or availability. Despite being informed of our confirmed Influenza A case, the doctor proceeded with an inappropriate course of treatment, which only worsened the situation. It would have been far more responsible to recommend that we first obtain a test kit before prescribing any medication.",
