Also very clear in his explanation of how he would clean my teeth so that I was more assured of what to expect. And will ensure I was ok and not in pain. I think most memorable is he keeps the session very humorous and light hearted so that I would not be nervous. Finally the result is very clean teeth. He was able to clean areas my former dentist missed and do it very well. He would also provide good advice on how to maintain dental hygiene better.\nI’m really scared of dentists but the visit to Dr Sebastian was really a pleasant experience.\n10 stars for this dentist!!!",

On top of that, the Malay doctor had no professionalism, openly scolding the staff in front of patients. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing to watch. This place is a disaster.

Apparently, the dentist needs time to send children off and tidy the house before coming here to set up for appointments. It's frustrating for people who come in early, only to find out there's a 1 hour and 15-minute wait for the dentist to arrive, followed by another 15-20 minutes to set up before seeing the first customer of the day. It might make more sense to just open at 11 and stop wasting people's time.",
