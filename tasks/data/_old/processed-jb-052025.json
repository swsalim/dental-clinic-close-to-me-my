Also very clear in his explanation of how he would clean my teeth so that I was more assured of what to expect. And will ensure I was ok and not in pain. I think most memorable is he keeps the session very humorous and light hearted so that I would not be nervous. Finally the result is very clean teeth. He was able to clean areas my former dentist missed and do it very well. He would also provide good advice on how to maintain dental hygiene better.\nI’m really scared of dentists but the visit to Dr Sebastian was really a pleasant experience.\n10 stars for this dentist!!!",

This may not be the cheapest but not the most expensive dental clinic m. Anyway i highly recommend.",

Her scaling technique is equally impressive; my teeth have never felt so clean!\n\nWhat stands out the most is her sense of responsibility and professionalism. She takes the time to explain procedures, ensure her patients are comfortable, and follows up to make sure everything is healing well. Dr. Chan combines expertise with a warm and friendly attitude, making every visit a pleasant experience. Definitely a 5-star dentist!",

Apparently, the dentist needs time to send children off and tidy the house before coming here to set up for appointments. It's frustrating for people who come in early, only to find out there's a 1 hour and 15-minute wait for the dentist to arrive, followed by another 15-20 minutes to set up before seeing the first customer of the day. It might make more sense to just open at 11 and stop wasting people's time.",

Ingatkan situ dah terbaik, sekali Klinik Pergigian Larkin lagi terbaik👍\nNurse kaunter depan peramah, senyum, dan cakap dengan baik. Nurse dan Dr Gigi di dalam pun sangat baik. Pergi pukul 8pagi, 8.45 pagi dah siap scaling gigi. Gila cepat. Rekod paling cepat di klinik gigi dengan bayaran cuma Rm3 untuk scaling gigi. Nikmat apa lagi yang kau dustakan.\nSepanjang aku hidup, nurse dan Dr Gigi paling terbaik di mana2😂😆😍 Terima kasih. 6bulan lagi saya akan datang.",

However, when I approached the front desk, I was informed that the doctor would not be seeing any more patients as the doctor wanted to close the clinic—without any explanation.\n\nI was shocked and disappointed, especially  your stated closing time is 5:30 PM. Have another 1 hour left.It made me feel like the clinic does not value its patients or their time.\n\nI took time out of my day to come to your clinic, only to be turned away for no valid reason. I’m very frustrated by this experience and, unfortunately, I will not be returning. All the best!!.",

Despite the positive reviews given by many, the experience was far from satisfactory. Dr. Goh made commitments regarding the completion of a crown within two sessions, only to change the plan abruptly to require three sessions, causing considerable inconvenience given the time constraints and urgent need to work overseas which have been explained to her repeatedly.\n\nDespite the request for an explanation, Dr. Goh failed to provide one personally, relying instead on the customer service team to address her mistake. This lack of accountability only intensified the situation, highlighting her insincerity.\n\nShe only made the helpful people from the customer service team to front her mistake made. Would strongly advise against seeking dental care from this clinic and waste your money especially so if you're rushing for time. And especially not an appointment with Dr. Goh.",

She wouldn’t even let me finish my questions before cutting me off. It felt like she was rushing to get rid of me rather than providing proper care. Additionally, her equipment seemed outdated, which might explain why she was unwilling to proceed. If you’re looking for a dentist who listens and provides quality treatment, I would not recommend this place.",

But dr.james did the procedure so professionally and it did not swell eventhough my case abit complicated. The dr did not rush eventhough the procedure took more than 1.5hours to complete and beyond the clinic operational hour. the receptionist also was very helpful. They even follow up next day after procedure on my condition. Definitely will come back for next wisdom tooth removal.",

Macam kita tak ada kerja lain pula. Appointment shud make it faster & smoother. Ini tidak, appt at 2, sampai sharp at 2 pun masih kena tunggu berjam. Another issue is, patient braces bertukar doktor? Consult dengan doktor lain, datang appointment dengan doktor lain. Lepastu treatment plan berbeza. The doctor pun unsure apa plan yg sepatutnya untuk patient. How is that possible????

She helped me to clean it and fix it. Best part is, I got myself WaterPik and since then, my tooth condition has improved. I bumped into her in JB and she asked me about my tooth clenching at night and advice me to wear it to protect my tooth so that I can have longer teeth shelf life and don't need to spend a lot of money. It's hard to find good dentist like her :-) Thank you Dr Annette!\n\n2020 review>Since we can't travel from Singapore to Malaysia, I had a virtual consultation with Dr Annette on my tooth and condition. She was super helpful and gave me lots of good advice to get pharmacy products to help ease my gum problems. She even recommend a good friend dentist of hers who is as good as her in Singapore to help me with my problem.\n\nSeldom we come across a dentist who is so helpful and caring to check on my condition. After the border is open, we will all come to seek Dr Annette's advice on our tooth!",

        "text": "I’m glad I found an experienced dentist who was able to identify my oral issues when many others couldn’t. Whenever I went for scaling and polishing, most dentists would tell me my teeth were very clean. Such comments felt like a taboo to me because there are always hidden or hard-to-reach areas that a toothbrush can't properly clean.\nToday, my teeth feel incredibly clean. Before starting the procedure, Dr. Ng mentioned that her scaling might be more painful compared to other dentists. She repeatedly confirmed that I was okay with it before proceeding. Her treatment focused not on surface cleaning but on deep cleaning.\nIt’s rare to find such a dentist nowadays because many people are afraid of pain, so most dentists choose to focus only on surface cleaning to minimize discomfort. This approach is highly personal. If you value deep cleaning, Dr. Ng is absolutely the right choice. However, if you are pain sensitive, I wouldn’t recommend visiting her, as your gums may need 2-3 days to recover after the procedure.",

The nurses are old timers with superb knowledge and experience, almost like dentist themselves minus the certs. .\nWent back for scaling, braces and tooth implant + bone graft as part of the process. Also took my teenage daughter to extract her 4 wisdom teeth at one-go following the dentist’s advice. I'd say perfect professionalism and experience, I didn't compare much on the price but I am happy with it. Personally I strongly recommend it. Dr and nurses were patient and did not care how long it would take, but cared abt delivering good outcome. It is tucked in a corner walking distance from JB City Square Mall.\nTQ Dr Chen and nurses sisters 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",

Recently, one implant crown came loose (see photos) and my Singapore certified “Straumann” dentist confirmed the implant is not \"Straumann\" brand because there is no “Trademark” logo imprint on them. The screw threads were worn!!! Straumann implants and screws are LIFETIME warranty! My other implants 9 years ago are still very good. ### BEWARE!!!! ### NEVER GO BACK to this dentist.

The clinic is very nicely done up, feels relaxing sitting and waiting for my turn and I didn’t have to wait long after the registration process to be called into the treatment room.\n\nDr Yew was assigned to me and her services were excellent. She was warm and inviting (I somehow always have this terrible fear of dentists) and that helped a lot with my anxiety. She then proceeded to do a check of my teeth and found that two fillings were worn out and showed some signs of initial decay, taking photos of the affected areas and spending the time and effort to explain the situation. During the treatment she constantly checked in if I was ok, and was very understanding towards my fears / low pain threshold.\n\nIn the end, I spent a total of RM439 on two posterior tooth fillings (RM140 each), a scaling and polishing (RM99 as advertised) and an air polishing (RM60) as I had dark tea stains in between teeth that normal polishing were unable to remove. Dr Yew also showed me the after photos of my teeth and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Would recommend this dental clinic to anyone looking for affordable yet professional dental services - personally I will also be back.",

I’ve always been scared of dental treatments, but after getting treated here, I don’t hate dentists anymore! The dentist was very detailed and took the time to explain everything clearly, which made me feel much more comfortable. My husband also had a treatment here and was very satisfied with the service. We will definitely come back whenever we need dental care. Highly recommended!",

        "text": "Subject: Lack of Communication and Unprofessional Conduct at IMC Dental (City Square Branch)\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nI am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction and disappointment regarding the recent experience I had at your City Square branch. I have been a loyal and regular client of IMC Dental and have introduced several new customers to your clinic over the years. However, the treatment I received during my recent interaction was unacceptable and deeply concerning.\n\nDue to illness, I was unable to attend a scheduled appointment. While I acknowledge the importance of honoring appointments, I was genuinely unwell and resting at home, and unfortunately, it slipped my mind. I was prepared to provide a medical certificate to explain my absence, yet this was dismissed without consideration.\n\nI was met with rudeness from the front desk and from Dr. B, who claimed that missing the appointment was “disrespectful” as I had been given a priority slot. However, I was never informed that my appointment held such status — it was simply scheduled based on the availability provided. Furthermore, I was told I would only be accepted as a walk-in going forward, which contradicts the clinic’s usual practice of not accommodating walk-ins.\n\nThis situation clearly reflects a breakdown in communication and a lack of empathy. I felt unfairly blamed and disrespected, despite being a long-term client. The response from your staff showed no flexibility or professionalism and left me extremely disappointed.\n\nCustomers have the right to reschedule appointments for valid reasons, including illness and work commitments. I expected more from a clinic I have supported for so long, and I am disappointed that my loyalty was disregarded.\n\nI request that this matter be investigated and addressed accordingly. I hope IMC Dental will take the necessary steps to improve its communication practices and ensure all clients are treated with respect and understanding.\n\nI look forward to your response and a fair resolution to this issue.\n\nSincerely,",

Added the details - made appointment of filling, asked to do X-Ray first, after that ask whether I can come back at afternoon as many customers now. When came back at afternoon, waited close to an hour, in between asked the counter but just ask me to wait, asked again then only told me the truth that no water supply since morning and not able to do filling today. Should have told me at morning so can go to other clinic but still cheated me to earn the money of X-Ray.",

Daughter had her 2nd extraction and she was visibly more relaxed this time with Dr Chong's calm, patient and humourous demeanor. As before, Dr Chong is assuring and gentle. I came for a review after the re-rootcanal done last month. My 1st root canal done 15 years gave me problems and Dr Chong provided me options and alternatives. What I'm really touched and impressed was how he was really trying to help save the tooth than to turn to easy solutions. The ethics and bedside manners of Dr Chong is really remarkable! Highly recommended!",

So when I drove from Woodlands causeway,  it took about 20 minutes, and as long as u made an appointment and arrived on time,  there was no wait at the clinic. But you needed to exchange your shoes for their indoor slippers at the entrance. Though parking could be quite difficult to find if your appointment was in the afternoons.\n\nInterestingly,  unlike in SG, where you needed to do an x-ray and have a thorough check before the dentist would proceed with the procedure,  here there was no x-ray required here, and the doctor would take your word and went on to give you what you wanted.  So, in my case,  since it was to fill up some parts of my teeth with partial dentures,  my existing or new cavities were not addressed. It was only looked into when I asked about it on my 2nd visit to fit the denture.\n\nIn any case, the partial denture was fitted in nicely, and I'm pleased with it. I'm not sure about the price as I did not compare it to other clinics,  but it seemed reasonable at RM1700 (Uploaded the price list in my review)",

First briefing through my options and the costs involved then briefed on what's she going to do in every step, giving me a full confidence on what's going on. The full cost ended a damaged of RM 1,210 for about a 75mins session (30mins a laborious effort to extract to evade a surgery, next 30mins was a surgery).\nDo you think this cost is worthy in JB KSL?",

Now I have to drink whole bunch of milk or calcium to grow my teeth back! God knows if I ever have normal teeth again. I don't usually give bad reviews but teeth is something you can't take it lightly coz it's a permanent thing. Charging Rm160 for it even after I left with disappointment. I don't think it's recommended to come here. Don't ever come!",

The clinic was clean, well-organized, and equipped with modern technology, which immediately put me at ease.\n\nDr. Akmal Nasreen was incredibly kind and took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly. Throughout the extraction, they ensured I was comfortable and pain-free. The entire process was much smoother than I expected, and I felt reassured every step of the way. PAIN SCORE IS ZERO.\n\nAfter the procedure, I received clear aftercare instructions and follow-up support, which really helped with my recovery. I’m so grateful for the excellent care I received and would highly recommend this clinic to anyone needing dental treatment, especially wisdom tooth extraction. Truly a 5-star experience!",

When I first came to him, I was dealing with constant jaw pain, and it was really affecting my day-to-day life.\n\nDr. Chong was patient and thorough, taking the time to explain everything and make sure I understood my options. The Invisalign treatment not only straightened my teeth but also eased my jaw pain significantly. I can’t believe how much better I feel now.\n\nAfter that, he did my implants and onlays, and they look and feel so natural. I was a bit nervous about the procedures, but Dr. Chong made the whole experience smooth and comfortable. He always made sure I felt at ease and answered any questions I had.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Dr. Chong is how much he genuinely cares. He’s not just fixing teeth — he’s improving people’s lives. I’m so much happier with my smile now, and the pain relief has been life-changing.\n\nIf you’re looking for a dentist who’s skilled, caring, and trustworthy, I highly recommend Dr. Chong. I couldn’t be happier with my experience!",

After my orthodontic treatment was completed, she insisted on selling me additional, unnecessary procedures to \"enlarge\" four of my front teeth. She even suggested replacing my perfectly healthy teeth with crowns for purely aesthetic reasons.\n\nBack then, I didn’t know what a crown was (I was 23 y/o at the time), and when I asked her if the procedure would cost extra, she blatantly lied to me and said no. By the time it was too late—when my teeth had already been filed down and fitted with temporary crowns—I was slapped with a hefty bill for the crowns!\n\nThis happened back in 2016, and I’m leaving this review today because not a single day goes by without me regretting replacing my completely healthy teeth with crowns at this clinic. The dentist didn’t explain what the procedure would entail, and now I’m stuck with this decision for the rest of my life, ruining my teeth in the long term.\n\nFor others who are visiting this dental clinic, I’m not sure if the dentist who worked on my teeth still works here, but please get a second opinion on whatever treatment they’re offering you before irreversible damage is done.",

I came all the way from Singapore and requested to get 4 fillings done in one shot :))) something not many clinics would agree to. But Dr. Taqi was incredibly understanding and accommodating, knowing my situation.\n\nFrom the start, all my enquiries were answered clearly and respectfully. I even asked to see examples of the dentures I was planning to get, and both Dr. Taqi and the nurses were super helpful and patient in showing me everything I needed to know.\n\nThe front desk ladies were also really friendly and approachable, which made the whole experience even more pleasant. And the best part? The waiting time was almost nonexistent, I handed over my IC and within a minute, I was already being called in. Everything went so smoothly from start to finish.\n\nHighly recommend this clinic! Thank you to the whole team for making my visit such a positive one. 🫶",

Waited till 1pm.. staff is still sending us confirmation right in front of us…. ? N rather un-responsive to check when’s our turn. Neither did she go check with dentists. Waited till 1.. we gave up.\n\nWe saw people who walked in.. got to go first\nWe saw people who didn’t seem to have appt go in first too. Huh? Ok maybe we see wrongly / they are here for emergencies.. but they just ask us to wait and didn’t want to say anything else. Alamak. We decided to forgo our appointments.\n\nBut I’d say.. their rates are 1 of the cheapest in jb.. n they had a high google rating (which was why we went over.. ). Not angry.. but Sian because we Wasted transport & our off day.\n\nclinic apologised some time later",

Which overcome the stigma i have whenever i go for a dental check up.\n\nThe nurses team was attentive and informative as well. Prompt response on whatsapp and able to answer all my queries.\n\nOverall, plesant experience and worthy of this 5 stars review. Thank you!",

My main concern was to get braces, and I was hoping for a clear treatment plan and guidance. However, I was advised by Dr. [Name] to begin by treating my gum disease before proceeding with braces. Trusting your expertise, I followed the recommendation and began the treatment.\n\nTo date, I have spent over $4,000 and several months undergoing treatment, only to be told recently that I will need to wait another four months before a final decision can be made regarding braces. What’s more distressing is that during a consultation with the braces specialist, I was informed that the estimated cost of the full procedure—including retainers, consultations, scaling, and X-rays—would be approximately $20,000 to $25,000.\n\nHad this information been shared with me at the beginning—especially by the braces specialist—I would have had the opportunity to consider all my options, whether to continue treatment with your clinic or seek more affordable alternatives elsewhere. Despite the high cost, I chose to proceed because I trusted that I would receive professional care and see positive results. Unfortunately, that has not been the case.\n\nI want to make it clear that I have all recordings, videos, and receipts from day one until today as documentation of my entire experience. This situation has not only affected me financially but also caused me significant emotional stress. I feel misled and extremely disappointed.\n\nI hope you take this matter seriously and provide a clear explanation and resolution. If this issue is not addressed appropriately, I will have no choice but to consider further action.\n\nSincerely,\nKayalvizhi Amurthalingam",

Both Dr Lim Kiat Lin and Dr Saw Woon Ling were extremely professional and honest in assessing what they need to do. They examined and discussed and explained to me what and how they will carry out the implant surgery. They carried out the surgery so well that by the time I boarded the bus returning to Singapore the bleeding had stopped. They injected a localized\nanesthesia on my  lower gum before carrying out the surgery and I took only 1 pain killer tablet . I did not feel any pain at all after that. I will be going back to the dental clinic 3 months later for the crowning of my implants and the measurement for my dental bridge.

My orthodontic treatment went smoothly, and now my teeth look beautifully aligned—I’m extremely happy and confident with my smile.\n\nBecause Dr. Lou is in high demand, there’s usually a bit of a wait before each appointment. However, the results and the quality of care I received made it completely worth it. He’s patient, thorough, and genuinely cares about his patients’ well-being.\n\nThe other doctors and staff at the clinic are also very friendly and welcoming.

It gave me a clearer understanding and peace of mind.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience with Dr. Chong and would highly recommend her to any parents looking for a dentist who truly understands and cares for children.\nThank you, Dr. Chong, for your amazing work and compassion!",

Dr. Jolene is, first and foremost, a polite and extremely transparent doctor. I appreciate the fact she's honest with her patients (as I think, in this day and age, that's a rare thing to find) & she isn't pushy about anything either. She's someone who truly puts in care in both her patients and clinic. And honestly, I'm looking forward to my next extraction because of the good experience(s) I had. I do believe it's because she understands my situation and takes extra care/time to make sure I'm doing okay (and gives me time to close my mouth or so if I need to).\n\nI appreciated her telling me to rest a bit when she saw me closing my jaw a little; it was a small yet impressionable gesture which I genuinely appreciated. :) I thank her nurses for being attentive and accommodating too!\n\nI think when you come across a clinic that not only looks good, but is well maintained and has staff that's been there a long time & most are still as bubbly, you can kinda guess the person running has their heart in their practice & doing their best. 💗 My mum and I are grateful to have found Pink & White Dental for sure. Looking forward to seeing Dr. Jolene again! God bless always!",

        "text": "I visited Asiaa Dental Clinic yesterday for a teeth whitening session, along with scaling, polishing, and an additional tooth filing procedure. My friend recommended me as she was quite pleased with their treatment. I was attended to by Dr Thasha, and I must say—I’m thoroughly impressed with both her and the team’s overall service and attitude.\n\nDr Thasha was patient and attentive, clearly explaining each step of the procedures beforehand. Throughout the session, she and the staff consistently checked in to ensure I was comfortable and doing well.\n\nDuring the second stage of the whitening treatment, I experienced an unexpected reaction—intense numbness and a burning sensation on my lips, which left me panicking as it was something I’d never felt before. The staff responded immediately, informing Dr Thasha, who attended to me promptly. She remained calm and professional, reassuring me that some patients may have such reactions when the lips come into contact with the chemical. She also explained that the severity of the reaction can vary between individuals. My lips were visibly swollen and appeared burned by the end of the session, but Dr Thasha comforted me that it will disappear after 1-2 days and reduced the duration for the final stage of the treatment to prevent further discomfort. She also told me to contact them if the condition doesn't improve.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after the session, I experienced sudden and intense sharp pain in the bottom front row of my teeth. Dr Thasha checked in on me, and I informed her about the pain. She kindly provided ibuprofen, which helped relieve the pain slightly. I was also given fluoride mousse and a soothing gel for my teeth and lips to bring home for aftercare.\n\nWhat truly touched me was the follow-up—a WhatsApp message from the clinic the next day to check if I was feeling better. Their care and concern really stood out to me.\n\nWhile the reaction and pain I experienced were likely due to my naturally sensitive teeth, I am still very pleased with the service provided. I highly recommend Asiaa Dental Clinic for their professionalism, warm service, and affordable pricing. The location is also relatively close to KSL (about 10mins walk), although do note that certain part of the clinic is currently undergoing renovation.\n\nThank you Dr Thasha and the team :)",

So always try to drag my dentist appointment.\n\nToday I finally meet a Doctor that makes me feel relax during my teeth cleaning .

That's new, you rarely find people open shop and say to walk in customers that they \"don't sell\" items that they actually have.

Back then, I got stuck in a massive jam to JB and had to postpone my appointment last minute — they were so understanding and rescheduled it to a date that was super convenient for me without any hassle.\n\nJust yesterday, they impressed me again. I needed a last-minute appointment for both my in-laws to get extractions done. Despite the short notice, they managed to slot in an afternoon session at 2:30pm for both of them — which was already amazing service.\n\nWe accidentally went to the wrong dental clinic and had to rush over to theirs, arriving slightly late around 2:45pm. Thankfully, the staff were patient and kind enough to wait for us. After a smooth registration process, the doctor promptly called in my in-laws one after the other with no long waiting time.\n\nThe extractions were done very fast and efficiently. Both my in-laws came out with no pain and big smiles — they were genuinely happy with the experience. That kind of care and professionalism is hard to come by.\n\nI highly recommend S Smilings Dental to anyone looking for trustworthy, gentle, and accommodating dental care!",

I had severe toothache and sensitivity for months, even after a filling. The pain spread to other teeth, making it hard to enjoy simple things like a warm beverage in the cold mornings or cold drinks after running out in the sun without the sensitivity or nagging fear at the back of my mind.\n\nDr Fung listened attentively to my concerns and explained all possible scenarios that gave me confidence that made me feel truly involved in my own care.\n\nShe performed a CBCT scan on-site, found cracks causing the pain, and diligently removed them. Now, I can drink hot and cold beverages pain-free.\n\nHer expertise and genuine care about patiences’ well-being made all the difference—she not only fixed a piece of tooth but also a peace of mind.\n\nLast but not least, the assistant at the counter was very professional and attentive, even arrange for cab service to my next destination!",

Instead of being seen as scheduled, I was asked to wait for hours with no guarantee of getting a slot. This lack of organization and disregard for patients’ time is very disappointing. I won’t be returning and wouldn’t recommend this clinic to others.",

The staff was friendly, professional especially Saravanan, and made me feel comfortable from the moment I walked in. The dentist was thorough and explained the procedure clearly, which helped ease any nervousness I had.\nThe results of the whitening were noticeable right away, and my teeth have never felt cleaner after the scaling. The clinic was also very clean and well-organized, which added to the overall positive experience. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone looking for high-quality dental care.",
