However, when I approached the front desk, I was informed that the doctor would not be seeing any more patients as the doctor wanted to close the clinic—without any explanation.\n\nI was shocked and disappointed, especially  your stated closing time is 5:30 PM. Have another 1 hour left.It made me feel like the clinic does not value its patients or their time.\n\nI took time out of my day to come to your clinic, only to be turned away for no valid reason. I’m very frustrated by this experience and, unfortunately, I will not be returning. All the best!!.",

Dr. Goh made commitments regarding the completion of a crown within two sessions, only to change the plan abruptly to require three sessions, causing considerable inconvenience given the time constraints and urgent need to work overseas which have been explained to her repeatedly.\n\nDespite the request for an explanation, Dr. Goh failed to provide one personally, relying instead on the customer service team to address her mistake. This lack of accountability only intensified the situation, highlighting her insincerity.\n\nShe only made the helpful people from the customer service team to front her mistake made. Would strongly advise against seeking dental care from this clinic and waste your money especially so if you're rushing for time. And especially not an appointment with Dr. Goh.",

Throughout the process, Dr. Sho was professional and thorough, and the dental assistants were highly efficient, providing excellent support. The whole team made sure I was at ease, and the entire experience was smooth and stress-free.\n\nI am so pleased with the results and couldn’t be happier with the level of care and expertise provided.

Very happy that he was able to see me on such short notice - we had walked in, intending to make an appointment for the next day, but was told he was available now.\n\nSet up is neat and clean, with the proper equipment available. Explaining every step of the way, and constantly checking if I was okay and how I was feeling. Gave valuable tips on how to use the Waterpik to floss the teeth. Such a nice young man!\n\nPrices are reasonable, and I’m glad I’ve finally found a dentist I am not terrified of doing dental work, so gentle & competent, and conveniently located in Mutiara Rini.",

I face a situation when I arrive on 1.30pm (Clinic open on 2pm), already have 2 patients seat on the chair, we consider is third. Time around 1.40pm, a group of 3 ladies, just direct stand and Q at clinic’s door and without asking opinion from patient came early. And 3 minute later, another guy just reach also direct queue behind that mentioned group. Is very unfair to the patient reach early and push behind on the waiting queue. I advise clinic to do something about this like have number/tickets system. To avoid this unhappy issues happen. Tq",

Macam kita tak ada kerja lain pula. Appointment shud make it faster & smoother. Ini tidak, appt at 2, sampai sharp at 2 pun masih kena tunggu berjam. Another issue is, patient braces bertukar doktor? Consult dengan doktor lain, datang appointment dengan doktor lain. Lepastu treatment plan berbeza. The doctor pun unsure apa plan yg sepatutnya untuk patient. How is that possible???? Kita bayar, bukan datang review free free. Sedih ya bila kena macamni setiap kali datang klinik.",
