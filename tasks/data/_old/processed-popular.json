We took the ticket and registered then we wasted a lot of time waiting to be called, not knowing that we needed to go to the counter to inform them again then we had to proceed to timbang our baby. Thank God for sending a kind soul to us to guide us what to do. I saw many people came in looking so lost not knowing where to go or what to do.\n\nThe number system also was very bad, after giving the blood test to the lab we waited there to be called as this was the process flow last year when we were here. Not knowing that they were calling our number at another side for consultation. The number system on left and right side are different which makes it really confusing.\n\nMy nurse from KK Metro Prima informed KK Kelana Jaya that I will be doing confinement under KK Kelana Jaya expecting someone would call to come for house visit but nobody called about that, only called to ask about bringing baby for jaundice test. Last year when I was doing confinement when I had my first child also the same thing, my nurse from KK Metro Prima informed KK Kota Damansara as she thought Bandar Utama is under that area to come for house visiting but they too didn’t visit.\n\nIm very disappointed with many of the KK service even though it’s free, except for KK Metro Prima, a small KK in a shop lot which is more family friendly where most of the nurses are polite, friendly and helpful.",

Came on a rainy day (walked all the way here drenched in rain) to the makeshift pharmacy and despite the bad weather, the staff there are still happily helping out patients and answering their questions. Yes, and I still need to come in another few days for my medicine 😂. Hope this issue gets solved once the KK fully reopens]\n\nUntuk farmasi sementara yang dibuat di tapak pasar tani / parkir sebelah Residensi TNB, boleh tak jangan suruh pesakit untuk datang sehingga 2 kali untuk dapatkan ubat mereka. Bukan berlaku sekali je tapi dah sampai kali kedua. Datang pada hari yang dah ditetapkan, lepas tu diberitahu untuk datang semula minggu depan\n\nKalau macam tu harap boleh dilanjutkan tarikh pengambilan ubat selama seminggu daripada awal-awal dengan bekalan ubat tambahan untuk tempoh yang sama",

I wasted a lot of time waited for nothing only to find out I have to put baby book into tray.\n\nOn one occasion I had to feed baby while my wife went for checkup. It was my first time visit KK. I proceeded to use the nursery/changing room unknowingly male cannot enter. Mid feeding I was told off by a nurse rudely I wasn't allowed to use the nursery room. I felt so much disrespect and discrimination. I had to carry a bagpack and baby out to continue feeding while standing. Are they discriminating single male parents out there??\n\nThough the KK treatment is cheap and/or free,we as patron deserve basic respect and decency as human being receiving medical care. This is not a prison or juvenile centre. We don't owe them anything. They are taking gov salary and benefits.\n\nSeparate occasion my wife use the same nursery room to make baby milk,she noticed some cockroach feces on the table.\n\nThere's one time I overheard a nurse talking very rudely to an elderly. The nurse was scolding the Chinese old grandmother why you never come to this station earlier/faster when I call your number so many times. I was so dumbfounded to hear she said that out loud. I cannot tolerate this kind of manner.\n\nWe as citizen enjoying our rights and benefits receiving cheap/free healthcare but downside we gotta see/face the nurses' sour face,rude and unfriendly manner.\n\nP.S: nurses didn't listen to my wife's question properly and simply give an answer. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\n\nDon't give me that \"it's cheap and free,if you don't like/not happy then don't go\" bullshit. Being a cheap/free healthcare doesn't give them the entitlement to treat citizen/patron poorly. Especially elderly!",

Initially I wanted to have a quick dental check up, but given the condition of my teeth was deteriorating, Dr Jay recommended doing a gum therapy. The process was very smooth, although the pain was still bearable, but Dr. Jay comforted and assured me throughout the procedure. My teeth before and after the procedure was night and day. I couldn't thank enough the service that was provided. They even did a follow up after the procedure and recommended a few toothbrusth I could use. I would definitely recommend this dental clinic to everyone else.",

Her calm demeanor and gentle communication make it easy to open up, and she always takes time to listen without judgment.\nI’m very grateful for her care and advice and today she made a difficult time of mine feel a little more bearable. Thank you Dr Kua",
