        "text": "I have experienced repeated issues with appointment scheduling, responsiveness, and clinic management, which have caused me significant inconvenience.\nFirstly, scheduling an appointment has been unnecessarily difficult. Despite my efforts to book in advance, I frequently face long waiting times and delays. The front desk staff assured me they would inform me of my appointment time, but after waiting for three weeks without any update, I had to follow up myself. This lack of communication is highly unprofessional and frustrating. I schedule appointments for my convenience, not for the convenience of your clinic, and I expect better service.\nSecondly, when I have an issue with my braces, I am required to wait for my assigned doctor to return, even though I have explicitly stated that any available doctor could assist me. This rigid system leads to unnecessary delays in my treatment, which is unacceptable.\nMoreover, I do not understand how such a large and well-established dental clinic lacks the necessary tools for treatment. On multiple occasions, I have been told that certain tools were unavailable, causing further delays. This is highly concerning and raises questions about the clinic’s preparedness and efficiency.",

The dentist explained everything in a patient and simple manner and made sure I understood everything before moving on. There was clear patient centred care and very good communication on next steps and general advice after procedures. I had two rounds of whitening with them and I am extremely happy with my results. I also had a filling fitted where the dentist made sure I wasn’t experiencing pain and helped me through the whole process especially as I was slightly distressed. Would highly recommend if you’re ever looking for a dentist in KL.",

I had a severe toothache in the lower left wisdom tooth area and consulted Dr. Loh for her expert opinion. I had recently done an X-ray at T*** Dental (don’t quite like the service provided, wait no service were provided only treatment), but Dr. Loh pointed out that the results were unclear and kindly offered to perform another X-ray at no additional cost. It’s evident that the doctors here genuinely care about their patients rather than focusing solely on profit. I asked many questions, and Dr. Loh was attentive and answered them all in a friendly and reassuring manner. Because of the trust I have in them, I confidently placed myself in their care.\n\nProud to announced that I am now one tooth lesser!",

Came for the ICON resin infiltration treatment for my white spots and am amazed by the results. Was a bit skeptical regarding the effectiveness of the treatment but it was really successful in removing the white spots that I’ve had my whole life. I think it’s due to the Dr being very meticulous 👍🏽 He also explained the procedure well. Thank you to the Dr and the assistant for being so patient and trying their best to achieve the best results. Especially to the assistant for being kind and helping me feel comfortable! Whole treatment lasted around 3 hours for 6 teeth including consultation and scaling.\n\nHowever I felt that the team could have better prepared me for the post treatment implications of wearing a mouth opener for too long, it was okay for the first two hours but the last hour it started to feel very uncomfortable. Although the team constantly checked in with me on my comfort level, and encouraged me to relax and bite/close my mouth the issue for me was how hard it was pressing against my gums. Ended the treatment having really painful and sore gums due to the prolonged pressure and irritated and bumpy skin around the corners of my mouth (I also have sensitive skin). Just a note to those who are thinking of doing the treatment close to any special event they have.",

However, it's getting harder and harder to book her now as in we have to wait for 2-3 months in order to book her. Thus, I decided to give it a try to have other Dr in this clinic to work on our teeth. I booked for my mum and myself. Two weeks after the treatment, my mum told me that her teeth didn't feel comfortable. It’s not that it only happened after two weeks, but it’s because she gave it some time to see if it would go away. Honestly, I've been feeling the same as well and i thought it was just me. We feel that our teeth have become more sensitive than ever especially when we eat (not even cold drinks or food, just normal food). Disappointed experience.",

The entire hour or so procedure was painless and even pleasant—which I think speaks of the precision and care of the dentist. Soothing music played in the background and you couldn’t wish for a dentist with a kinder, more gentle or compassionate demeanor than Dr Genia. With the aid of a mirror the doc showed me the problem areas and laid out the remedies. The old oxidized black amalgam filling was replaced with natural white composite filling. I also noticed that the clinic was so clean some patients walked around barefoot and staff were extremely kind. There’s also free espresso you can help yourself to in a corner. I am happy to say that this is the first time that I had enjoyed a dentist visit or felt more at ease: most experiences left me with an ouch in the mouth and an ouch in the pocket. Finally I found a dentist who shares my belief that a dentist visit shouldn’t be painful nor something to be feared. Kudos to J&G clinic for being a new age dental clinic with a heart. 🙏😍🥰😘🌹",

What's more, the doctor was gentle and professional, and the treatment wasn't as painful as I initially expected, in fact I almost felt nothing. For someone who had visited a lot of dental clinics before, this is a very new and reassuring experience. If I had met the doctor sooner, my teeth would be in a much better condition.

They simply pushed me into wearing aligners and forcibly moved my teeth outward. As a result, my teeth are still misaligned, and I now have severe protrusion (buck teeth), with my bite completely off and my facial profile noticeably altered. This has caused me immense anxiety and loss of confidence over the years. I’ve wasted not only a significant amount of money but also three precious years of my life.\n\nLater on, I consulted several professional dental clinics, and every single one of them told me that I needed to have at least four teeth extracted before starting orthodontic treatment. DCA completely overlooked this and failed to give me a proper diagnosis or treatment plan. They just pushed forward with the aligners without truly considering what was best for my dental health.\n\nI deeply regret choosing DCA. I’m sharing my experience to warn others: always consult multiple professional orthodontists and confirm whether extractions are necessary before starting treatment. Don’t blindly believe promises like “fast results” or “no need for extractions.” You may end up like me—paying a high price not just financially, but physically and emotionally as well.\n\nI hope DCA will take responsibility for my case and offer a formal response. And to anyone considering clear aligners: please do your research carefully.",
