I had problem with a tooth and x-ray showed another tooth underneath the gum and a Penang dentist thought that is the problem which caused the pain. He told me to have a minor tooth surgery to take out the tooth underneath gum so that it does not affect the top tooth. As I happened to be going home to Miri so i didn't do the minor surgery but went to check it up with Dr Yie instead. He told me the underneath tooth is a good tooth. There is no reason to extract it. He also went through the risk associated with such extraction with me which the Penang one omitted. In his view, it was the tooth on top that was in decay and need extraction. He also said once the top one is extracted out, there is chance that the bottom one could come up. I took his advice and did a normal extraction on the top decaying tooth. Few weeks later the good tooth at the bottom came out indeed. Thankfully i wen to see him. Or i would have lost 2 teeth - one at the top as it is decayed, and one the underneath one which is  perfectly good.",

From the moment I stepped in, I was pleasantly surprised by the clinic‚Äôs cozy and minimalist design, which instantly put me at ease. The warm and inviting atmosphere made a significant difference in calming my initial nerves.\nThe dental assistants were exceptionally gentle and approachable, ensuring that I felt comfortable and well taken care of throughout my visit.

Dr. Andrew, the dentist who attended to me, was not only highly skilled and knowledgeable but also incredibly gentle in his approach. He took the time to explain every step of the treatment, which reassured me and helped me feel more at ease. His expertise and attention to detail truly reflected the clinic‚Äôs commitment to top-quality dental care.\nAnother highlight of my visit was the clinic‚Äôs reasonable pricing, which I found to be a great bonus considering the high standard of service provided. Throughout the entire treatment, I was so relaxed that I even dozed off a few times‚Äîa testament to how comfortable and painless the experience was.\nFor anyone looking for professional, high-quality dental care in a soothing and stress-free environment, I highly recommend En Dental Clinic.

She suffered a month of toothache before finally coming over to MySmile after a lot of convincing and some form of 'bribe '.\n\nShe came out of the dental clinic with a big smile and a thumbs up after her procedure.\n\nThank you, Dr Jason Wong for your patience in explaining from A to Z about the nitrous oxide, the cleaning and scaling needed to be performed.\n\nI also must mention and complement Mdm Suzie, who assisted Dr Jason Wong that morning. She held my mother's hand, and spoke kindly throughout the procedure.\n\nThe clinic texted us the next day to ask about my mother's recovery.\n\nThis is first class treatment.\n\nI strongly recommend this clinic to everyone who needs the 'gentle touch' of dental treatment.\n\nThank you, MySmile Dental.\n\nThe picture is of my mother watching TV at the clinic after two teeth extraction.",

Luckily, I listened to his advices. He explained the procedure and told me the post-filling discomforty in advance. Afterwards, the staff also told me what-to-do and not via WhatsApp. The staff also check-in on me the very next day and told me to inform them if any unusual symptoms occuring (which in my case, no pain or unusual symptoms).
