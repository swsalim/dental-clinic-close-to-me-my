I‚Äôve been twice once as an emergency and once for a professional cleansing and both times the service from the receptionist and dental helpers as well as from the dentist Dr. Tan Ni Wen herself were outstanding. Even though the first time I went the issue was not directly related to teeth but a muscle spasm in my jaw that prevented me from opening my mouth Dr. Ni Wen was very knowledgeable about it and gave me great recommendations. Also no matter for what you see her she takes her time to tell you all the information so you are as well informed about your own teeth as she is. If anyone needs a dentist in Penang I would absolutely recommend you to come here. Also don‚Äôt worry if you are a foreigner - just bring your passport for identification. Thank you to the whole clinic and especially Dr. Tan Ni Wen.",

The dentist was friendly, and made me feel comfortable throughout the treatment. The clinic is clean and very cozy,the waiting area even has pillows on the sofa, so you can lean back and relax while waiting. The doctor also gave me helpful advice on how to take better care of my teeth, which I really appreciate. I‚Äôm really satisfied with their service and will definitely come again in the future.

Booking an appointment with them is easy, and communication is smooth.\n\nDr. Ooi is skilled and takes the time to explain the procedure to patients while performing the scaling and filling. He is also very respectful towards his staff, which I genuinely appreciate.\n\nI previously had a bad experience at another dental clinic where the doctor shouted at and degraded the staff in front of patients. However, at Dentistree, I feel safe and comfortable. The clinic has a nice, well-maintained setting and a pleasant environment.\n\nOverall, I am very satisfied with my experience.",

The fee is very affordable as the registration fee was rm 1 , and the actual dental costs only rm2 ! The queue line wasnt very long. This year they revamped the old system as dental scaling cant be done on the spot this time around. I was given a 3 months appointment and i feel it is acceptable since it is not urgent. But i do hope dental procedures can be done more promptly as the staffs do not look busy at all. Car parks were not adequate but bike parking spaces are enough, so i ll advise visitors to come here by motorcycle .",

From the first consultation, the team was professional, understanding, and non-judgmental, putting me at ease despite my anxiety about dental treatments.\n\nThe wisdom tooth removal was seamless. My dentist was calm, skilled, and reassuring, and the recovery was surprisingly smooth, friends even commented on how little swelling I had. The experience was stress-free, with clear follow-up care and honest advice throughout.\n\nThis visit inspired me to take better care of my teeth. I‚Äôm now undergoing Invisalign treatment with Seet Dental and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. If you‚Äôre hesitant about dental visits, I highly recommend Seet Dental.

I went and checked with the nurse why do I have to wait when I had made appointment 2 days ago ?? The nurse just ask me to wait, ignoring me and continue calling next person for registration. Is this even professional ????? If you don't have the appointment system or if you don't know what's APPOINTMENT means then DO NOT TAKE APPOINTMENT !! WASTE PEOPLE'S TIME AND NOT PROFESSIONAL AT ALL.

Highly recommended.\n\nI had a wisdom tooth removal surgery in early January and although this differs according to each individual, my surgery only took around 15-20 minutes. The recovery process has been super smooth and the post-surgery pain subsided after 2-3 days with the help of prescribed medication.\n\nThe surgery itself wasn't painful - doctor & kind nurse/receptionist made me feel really comfortable. Very clean environment (must remove shoes at the entrance), clean toilet, free snacks & drinks provided while waiting.\n\nBe sure to follow their Facebook page because sometimes there are discounts - I went for a scaling + polishing session during their year-end promotion and the price was super worth it.\n\nDoctor is very friendly and gentle. Any questions can be discussed with them through Whatsapp.\n\nThe only minus point is that sometimes parking can be hard to find in that area, so it's better to come with Grab or park a bit further around Maybank area and walk.",

The reason I went there was I couldn't seem to find any dentist in Penang that could treat my abrasion after my varnish treatment that I did with my dentist in PJ thinned after 4 years. So I got a filling for my cavity, and filling for my abrasion. Personally I wasn't really happy with the white filling on my front tooth instead of the colourless varnish. Treatment wasn't cheap and the filling came out after one year. What really got to me was the fact that my regular dentist had to remove the remains of the fillings before he could put in new fillings and the removal of the remaining fillings on my sensitive tooth really set me off!!! This dentist did inform me the existence of one molar at the back of my mouth that I neglected but never offer any feasible solution other than just to brush my teeth. Charging standard price for sloppy dental work that I have to pay for other dentists to clean up.\nI do NOT recommend this dental clinic to anyone.\nFast forward now, I got my teeth cleaned, polished, cavities fixed, a small toothbrush to brush my molar and a retainer for my bruxism (which was the other contributor to my cavities). I also learned not to trust any dental clinic just because they called themselves \"dental surgery\".",

No upselling and only recommend what is necessary!\n\nI tried sandblasting the last time because my teeth have many stains and the result is long lasting. This time round the scaling is quick because my teeth is still in good condition! The price is around RM90 - 120 depending on condition.\n\nHighly recommended!",

A few years ago, at around the age of 10, my jaw failed to develop enough (a condition which can be known a small jaw). This caused me to have a set of very crowded and crooked teeth. So much so that I felt much embarrassed and became painfully self conscious, especially when I had my photo taken as I needed to smile for the pictures. Subsequently, I had the appliance Twin Block to correct my small jaw and after that a few crowded teeth were extracted for the braces. Now, I have my braces removed!\nThank you so much Dr. Chay and all your team for being so professional, patient and kind to me! I am now extremely happy as I can smile brightly without having to hide my once 'not so nice set of teeth'.\nI am truly very grateful to Dr. Chay and her team as they helped me through all these. I love Dr. Chay and her teamüíï",

Dr. Chay took the time to listen attentively to my concerns regarding my teeth-grinding, a problem I had been experiencing for quite some time without knowing the underlying cause. After a comprehensive examination, she skilfully diagnosed my teeth-grinding issue and explained the potential effects it could have on my dental health. Dr. Chay took the time to educate me about my condition and the importance of addressing it. She recommended a custom night mouth guard, which has made a significant difference in my quality of sleep and overall comfort. The mouth guard fits perfectly! Dr. Chay‚Äôs professionalism and dedication to her patients were evident throughout my experience. The staff at the practice is friendly and accommodating, making each visit a pleasant one. I highly recommend Dr. Chay for exceptional orthodontic care. Thank you, Dr. Chay!",

Since I couldn‚Äôt extract any teeth, I first consulted the dentist to ask if I could still get braces. He said it was possible, although the result might be slightly protruding. I was okay with that ‚Äî I just wanted my teeth to be aligned.\n\nDuring the treatment, I started feeling a gap in my gums. The dentist said he could fix it by grinding my teeth a little. My two front teeth used to be the same size, but after the grinding, they were no longer symmetrical. When I pointed this out, he denied it, which felt like he was shirking responsibility.\n\nEventually, I got my braces removed. At that moment, I didn‚Äôt notice anything unusual, but later I realized that the previously recessed area had shifted forward. It‚Äôs not obvious unless you look closely or take a photo ‚Äî then you can clearly see the asymmetry. My mouth looks crooked now.\n\nUnfortunately, it happened during the MCO period, so I couldn‚Äôt pursue the matter further with him. To this day, it still bothers me deeply. I really regret it.",

I have personally chose to go another clinic but unfortunately my sibling brought my dad to this clinic to fix his denture. I have to go along as I thought he had his lower denture done there. On the day of our visit she was very nice to us probably she knew my sister had her implants done with Dr. Ong and spent a good amount of money. We fix the date for my dad second visit there on the spot after Dr. Chong checked my dad and taken a mould. Dr.Chong said I should visit next week again and ask me to arrange with recep. When we were waiting for my sister appointment with Dr. Ong, the receptionist told us that it is fixed on coming Friday ,4pm as I ask her to give me a day n time. I said ok and even my maid heard it. As I repeated to her my maid. On the coming Friday I took my dad to the clinic only to be told that I came on a wrong date. The same receptionist said it should be on Tuesday. I took a look at her schedule n found that she wrote everything in pencil so it's easy for her to rub it off. I think she might have change the appointment date due to the casing couldn't arrive in time for my dad's appointment. So I ask if she forgot to inform me but she brushed me off and said no and nevermind. I said most clinic will send a gentle reminder nowadays why I haven't received any and being informed of the changes. She walked away from me and took her water bottle to drink. She kept evading me and ask her colleague to talk to me. That's when I feel this person is so unprofessional and demanded for an apology. I also asked to talk to Dr. Chong. The recep irresponsible behaviour caused me to think she has bad manners and also has double standard. She was so nice to my sister just because she had her expensive implants there and so rude to us because we haven't spend that much there. My dad already spent so much to fix lower denture and now upper denture about 3-4k. Has she no shame to let us waste our trip there and let 80+ old people go all the way under scorching heat to be there when he could be resting and I could be working. Remember one day you will be old too and if the same thing happened to you and your child what would you do. Pls be more professional!!!",

I needed a Endodontics specialist to examine a problem with my molar, and Dr. Tee provided a meticulous consultation. He concluded that a root canal treatment was indicated, and that my particular molar was a more complicated case. He addressed all aspects of the procedure, and I felt very comfortable with his professionalism, detailed explanation, and clinical experience. I am very happy to report that the procedure was a success, and  wholeheartedly acknowledge that Dr. Tee's clinical skills are of the highest caliber.\n\nI must also mention that he was ably assisted by his very competent nurse, and that the clinic is strongly managed by Stephen, a pleasant and extremely efficient office administrator. He provided me with clear supporting information as well as a smooth check-in and check-out process.\n\nI highly recommend this practice for any and all endodontic needs.\n.",

I was in severe pain but thanks to emergency root canal treatment, my pain was gone and I am pain free. Root canal treatment is a good option for temporary pain relief. Just that, after few years, I found out from CBCT scan that several root canal treatments failed, not all my root canal treatments performed by the doctor are successful. Some root canal treated teeth had problems after a few years and I had to extract them. The root canal treatment price is extremely high over here with no guarantee success, so if you have a lower budget, it is better to seek other dental professionals with a more reasonable price. And, in my experience as someone who had done seven root canal treatments, root canal treatment procedure is very hard, highly complicated, pricey with no guarantee success. In my case, I learnt that root canal treated teeth could get reinfected in few years time. So,  I highly doubted root canal treatment can remove all bacteria of an infected tooth. So,  please think twice before you decide.",

I had an all female team for both visits as I had an emergency root canal as I broke a tooth and was leaving the country in two days so they were kind enough to squeeze me in. Dr. Ong diagnosed my problem, explained things well,  and referred me to Dr. Cynthia for a one day root canal due to my timing. However, she did a very thorough and fantastic cleaning while I was there on the initial day.\n\nThe following morning, Dr. Cynthia was explained the procedure in detail. She did an excellent job with the local anesthetic where there was barely discomfort with injection, the local set in within a minute, and I fell asleep several times during the root canal because I had no pain. Dr. Cynthia finished before her estimated time for a more complicated root canal. There was little pain afterwards and one ibuprofen did the trick to keep the pain at bay that day with no subsequent pain thus far.\n\nRoza and the rest of the team were extremely attentive and courteous the whole time. Overall, it was the best experience that I've had than in the US with very affordable pricing. Highly recommend getting dental care here if you live here or are visiting and need care.",

She took the time to explain everything, checked in on me constantly, and made sure I felt safe. For the first time, I was able to relax during a dental procedure! The tooth filling itself was quick and painless, and now I feel so much more confident about future visits.\n\nIf you're someone who struggles with dental anxiety, I highly recommend Ting Prestige Dental.

They say we called you many times on two occasions we have told them our number. They have been calling wrong number. They was a digit missing, surely when you call you notice that they are not enough digits. My husband has to chase up after no contact. Was told his denture would be ready by 7 January 2025.  As they could not get through to my husband they rang his brother, so we called them back. They said we called you many times, so we asked which number she repeated the number and we told them they are missing a number. Now they asking for impression to take again. First time the impression was broken in transit, second time wax impression taken, now don't know why lab needs another impression. This is not how a dental practice should operate. Very disappointing, was going to recommend another friend but after my husband's experience I would avoid this place. No apology for the length of time it is taking or there error in recording wrong number. We have given them our number few times as they say they can't get through to us. So I wonder what they do!!!!\nHad we not paid some amount I would go elsewhere.\n\nThank you for the reply but its not true that we were too busy to answer the call. Your office have been calling incorrectly number on all occasions. One you reached my husband's brother we called you back immediately. No missed calls on my husbands phone as you never called his number. Even after comfirming his number with your office the first time this happened, your office kept calling the wrong number, so please accept the short comings of your office, instead of implying we were too busy.",

I had an excellent dentist for more than 10 years in Toronto and I was very sceptical to find a good dentist when I moved to Penang.\nOne of my friends from Penang referred me to Quay Dental back in March. I finally decided to setup my first cleaning appointment with Dr Liew in June and the rest is history.\nI enquired about the teeth whitening process and pricing at the end of my cleaning appointment. Dr Liew was very patience and walked me through the entire process from end to end and provided me with pros and cons to set my expectations and goal.\nI started my teeth whitening journey on July 18th and I decided to go with two sessions. The first picture below was taken before the first session on July 18th and the second picture was the final result after the second session on November 27th. Needless to say the transformation was remarkable within 4 months!\nMy sincere thanks to the Quay Dental crew for taking such a good care of my teeth in the last 6 months. A special shout out to Dr Liew for her professionalism and commitment to keep her promise to make me smile with confidence again!üòÅ",

However, I must admit, when it came to my recent root canal treatment, I had no other choice but to go through with it. To my surprise, I didn‚Äôt feel any pain at all‚Äîthank you, Doc!\n\nWhat truly sets Loh Dental apart is their thoughtful follow-up after treatment. Those small gestures of care and concern make a world of difference, showing just how much they genuinely value their patients' well-being. It‚Äôs not often you come across a clinic that offers such personalized attention.\n\nOn top of that, their prices are incredibly reasonable without sacrificing quality or service. Well done, Loh Dental!",
