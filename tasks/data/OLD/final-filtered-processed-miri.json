He told me to have a minor tooth surgery to take out the tooth underneath gum so that it does not affect the top tooth. As I happened to be going home to Miri so i didn't do the minor surgery but went to check it up with Dr Yie instead. He told me the underneath tooth is a good tooth. There is no reason to extract it. He also went through the risk associated with such extraction with me which the Penang one omitted. In his view, it was the tooth on top that was in decay and need extraction. He also said once the top one is extracted out, there is chance that the bottom one could come up. I took his advice and did a normal extraction on the top decaying tooth. Few weeks later the good tooth at the bottom came out indeed. Thankfully i wen to see him. Or i would have lost 2 teeth - one at the top as it is decayed, and one the underneath one which is  perfectly good.",

It’s a matter of appreciation and making that person feeling important. Mama always said “To make a person Happier”. I can’t argued with her about it:)\n\nDr Larry Yong Bright Smile Dental Clinic Yakin is the person we would like to show how truly grateful we are with his Service. His professionalism not only showed us how talented he is with the skills in dentistry. His personality, love, caring and patience are beyond our expectations.\nGrowing up I had a baddest experience with our Dentist in Edmonton. Because of him. I’d the worst fear going to any Dentists since then. I will navigate through the whole process of giving excuses not going to visit a Dentist.\nUntil this trip to Miri with my brother and SIL.\nThanks to our dear cousin June Chin  to made all these arrangements for us to meet Dr Larry Yong. He’s actually related to us (in some ways)\nLarry made sure his Dentophobia Susan Gugu is well taking care of by explaining to me what to expect and making sure nothing can be more scare than death 😂 😝\nI truly appreciate his love, caring and all the work he did for me. My teeth looks so beautiful now 😁😆😂\n\nNot forgetting to mentioned his beautiful assistants. They’re the beautiful souls as well.\nWe also would like to take this opportunity to show our appreciation To the front desk staffs, Dr Ain and her staffs.\nTHANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING OUR EXPERIENCES SO HAPPY AND POSITIVE.\n\nWe also would like to apologized for messing up your schedules. Being late\nMaking you guys to stayed late for us.\n\nWe Truly Appreciate each one of you 🙏🏻🥰😘😍\nUntil Then. Take great care of yourself\nContinue to be your best 😍\n\nBTW: MY FAMILY AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DR LARRY YONG & DR AIN",

This was at their second branch (they also have another one at Permaisuri).\n\nOne thing that stood out is how convenient it is—the clinic is open every day, making it easy to choose a date and time that suits your schedule. The appointment process was straightforward, and I appreciated the reminder message a day before.😊\n\nThe clinic itself is modern, clean, and welcoming. The waiting area is tastefully designed and comfortable, and there's even a children’s play area, which makes it very kid-friendly. 🥰\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was greeted warmly and brought directly to the treatment room—no waiting time at all. The clinic is well-organized and hygienic, especially the treatment and compressor rooms, which were spotless and fully equipped.\n\nI’m really glad I met Dr. Louis Siao—he was already prepared and waiting for me. Truly the best dentist I’ve ever met. He spoke gently, explained my dental condition thoroughly, and made me feel completely at ease.\n\nI had scaling and polishing done, which took about an hour. I was initially nervous due to previous bad experiences, but to my surprise, the entire procedure was painless with minimal bleeding—a huge difference from what I’ve experienced before.🥳🥳\n\nAfter the treatment, Dr. Louis personally cleaned and wiped my mouth gently and gave me useful aftercare advice. His dental assistant was also very kind and attentive.\n\nPrice is very reasonable and Payment was quick and smooth—no delays at all.\n\nThe service was top-notch. I was so satisfied that I immediately made an appointment for my brother.\nI’ll definitely be coming back again!👍👍👍",
