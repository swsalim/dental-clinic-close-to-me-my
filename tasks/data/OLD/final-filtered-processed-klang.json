While waiting for my turn, I did google this clinic and was totally shocked that it received a solid 5/5. At that point I believed we somehow hit a jackpot of coming across this clinic. The ambience of the clinic is so calming and beautiful. I was impressed by the interior design, and the big smiling Mona Lisa portrait definitely made me chuckle a little üòÇ As for the service, it was honestly superb and the best! Dr Siva is very kind and accommodating. He even checked my teeth and jaw and let me know that I actually had two missing teeth haha. He also happily showed me my old filling when I had concerns about it and assured me that it was still in good condition. Honestly, if you‚Äôre around the area, do consider visiting here! If you‚Äôre reading this review, I believe the Hari Raya promo will be available only until 15/03/25.",

First was a whole set of teeth review...recorded by the nurse. Then i am shown a screen pic of my issues which helped alot to give a \"dentist view\" of my teeth. Everything about the room was meant to put u at ease ( i dont know many people who like dentists so feeling at ease is a big thing). The doctor explained the procedure, gave me options, did a quick and neat work on my problem areas while responding to my need for quick breaks with much patience. She was good and I would go back for her to handle any future dental needs. Equipment and set up is very up to date.\nI must mention again the ladies at reception that help create my good first impression ...hard to get that effect anywhere and even harder at a dental clinic ...but they do it quietly and effectively.\nPrice wise the clinic charges the normal market rate for different procedures but i have experienced less good service for higher charges so I would say the private clinic fees is not a dealing breaker considering the service I received.\nThe clinic even followed up the next day via Whatsapp to ask how I was and I see this as professionalism with a heart....its something thats missing in much of our health care business.\nI still dont like any dental work but I would go back to Kencana if needed.

I had to remove my wisdom tooth and was so scared, but Dr. Ashini was incredibly patient and kind. She talked me through every step, was gentle, and made sure I felt comfortable the entire time. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met a dentist who cares so much for their patients.\n\nThe nurses were also really kind and reassuring, making the whole experience much easier for me. I highly recommend this clinic ‚ù§Ô∏èü•π",

        "text": "Hi treatment braces & scaling dgn Dr Ajmal memang terbaik, bagus. Xde rasa sakit, gusi elok, ada lebihan besi braces kt hujung tu dia potong, susunan gigi pun jadi elok macam plan. Tapi sebelum tu selama setahun buat braces dgn Dr Asyraf boleh dikatakan pengalaman yg sangat teruk. Lebihan besi braces xdipotong menyebabkan isi belah dlm pipi tu tercabut luka kena besi tu banyak kali sgt teruk even pakai wax pun masih luka yg banyak, plan utk susun gigi pun tiada pada awalnya sebab saya nak pindah ke klinik cawangan setapak tapi dikatakan tiada record plan. gigi pun asalnya nak rapatkan gap sikit didepan, tapi selepas setahun masih tiada perubahan dan lari ke blah lain pula. Tapi lepas tukar ke Dr Ajmal, 2bulan je dah nampak perubahan jelas dgn treatment yg lagi elok dan service layanan yg 100% lagi bagus berbeza dgn Dr Asyraf yg sebelum ni. Harap betul lah pakai braces ni 2 tahun sahaja seperti yg dijanjikan pada mula.",

Kaunter buka pukul 8am dan boleh dikatakan dr mula pendaftaran sehingga selesai cuma mengambil masa setengah jam sahaja. Dari kaunter pendaftaran sehinggalah doktornye teramat la cepat dan friendly. Masa buat scaling pon lancar. Jadi akan datang nak buat service lain pulak. Terima kasih semua.",

I went to Klinik Pergigian Bukit Kuda in Klang yesterday as that was the only clinic with available appt slot in MySejahtera. Was informed by the staff that I can go to Seksyen 15 or Bandar Botanic next time as it's nearer to my home. No need for appointment. Just go between 8-10am. My whole dental check-up there took less than 2 hours. üëçüèΩ and I paid only RM1 for registration and RM2 for scaling work. Dr Parveen Kaur was very friendly and gave me great advice on where to get my implants done.",

After previously visiting a general dentist who expressed uncertainty about my specific situation, I decided to seek the expertise of a dental specialist. That's when I discovered Dr. Chu's clinic.\n\nDr. Chu is an experienced dental specialist who took the time to thoroughly understand my unique needs and concerns. During the consultation, he provided expert guidance and reassurance, leaving me confident in his abilities. Based on his recommendations, I proceeded with wisdom teeth surgery under Dr. Chu's care.\n\nI am pleased to report that the surgery was a success, with no complications whatsoever. Dr. Chu's surgical skills were remarkable, and his precision and attention to detail throughout the procedure. The entire experience was smooth, which I attribute to Dr. Chu's expertise.",

        "text": "Hi. I went for scalling here on 29th October 2023 but I've been waiting for time to actually post my review. I just moved to Klang in 2022 so I'm trying to find the best dentist so I could stick to one only. During the booking it was fine. All through whatsapp. And I booked the RM99 scalling.\n\nOnce I arrived I need to fill in my details and I could tell the customer service was so-so because the way the front desk (indian woman) look at me. But I'm cool with it. Since its not the worst one I've experienced. Waiting time was adequate too.\n\nThe doctor was very nice and kudos to her she gave a lot of good advices and treat me very kindly.\n\nBut once I went to make the payment again at the counter, I asked if I could pay with card. She said can. But the worst yet to come lol, I said I'm using my credit card... I still remember the way she looked at me (scorn much) \"credit card? Are you sure this is credit card?\"\n\nI was stunt- do I look that MISKIN to have no cc? I wrote down there I'm a teacher. With the tone you trying to downgrade me like I'm lying ke I have a job? Sbb most of your customer college students eh? I still remember the look of her face macam hina betul saya ni.\n\nBefore I was a teacher, I was a customer service under LazadaMall... the way you sound was plain rude and not suitable to be FRONT OFFICE. I would advice the clinic to find someone else that have better attitude.\n\nI'll still give you 4 stars because shes the only problem here. Harap maklum. Thanks!\n\np/s : I  baru tulis review sekarang sbb everytime I saw your ads (saw it recently) mesti I terngiang-ngiang muka that girl lol",

Finally, I decided to check out the reviews on Google, and I was so relieved to find many positive comments. A lot of people, just like me, mentioned how painless the experience was, and how friendly the doctor was. This gave me the courage to make an appointment.\n\nAnd I‚Äôm so glad I did! The doctor was very kind and understanding. There was no judgment about the condition of my teeth. Today, I had painless scaling and filing, and it truly was painless. The pricing was also very reasonable. I highly recommend Kea Smile Clinic to anyone dealing with dental issues ‚Äì don‚Äôt let fear hold you back!\n\nThanks to Dr Darshyna & assistant.",

Staff india sorang ni yang duduk kaunter tu biadap sgt . Dia plak yang nak marah2 i bila i tanya apa yang mahal sgt ni ? Cara dia explain dari awal dah kurang ajar. Menekan suara dgn i . Sbb masa i datang dia kata tampal gigi rm100-150 so okay la .. So bila smpai doc ada letak ubat sbb gigi i dah nampak akar katanya . So okayla i paham . Tp bila nak byr dia cakap memula 300 lebih . Lepastu i terkejut la . Apa yang 300 lebih ? Sbb tampal je kan ? So masa dia explain tu la dia nak marah2 i . Dahla explain xbtl . Dia cakap ada FOC apa benda tah , sekali i tanya la gg mana yang FOC utk ubat gg tu ? Dia kata gg sebelah , i cakap sebelah mana ? Sbb satu batang je i tampal , satu lg doc letak ubat gg apa tah , so yg mana foc ? Sbb dia cas je yg gg doc letak ubat gg tu . Katanya sebatang gg ubat gg tu rm40 , tp bg rm30 , so cas dua batang jadi rm60 . Satu lg FOC. I tanya la FOC mana satu ?\nPastu dia benggang dgn i . Baru nak g check kat dalam . Last2 keluar balik cakap dgn i satu je cas . So xjadi la bayaran 300 lebih . Jadi la rm280 total semua . Tampal sebatang gigi ya rm280 . Sekali ubat dia letak dalam gg i . Haa cmtu la lebih kurang . Letih la i nak type panjang2 . Cuma kalau korang nak g klinik ni , pk la dalam2 . Harga mmg harga kayangan dekat sini . Kalau kayangan servis ok xpe . Ni macam hareem ! Sekian !
