Dr. Tay is so so patient with my boy and waited for him to relax before checking his teeth. Bribery was involved, but I'm a fan of whatever works! My toddler has a fear of dentists and isn't easy to work with but Dr. Tay was incredibly compassionate dealing with the tantrums and managed to take a good look at his teeth. He's so good with kids.

The whole process is like rushing me off saying no issue with my condition for flu & my lips.\n\nWhen I shared with the doctor am having some lips allergy, he said he can see the redness but never ask for how long this start to happen (am having lips eczema for a while) and just replied will give me some medicine so not to worry.\n\nI have no chance to continue cause he said is done. You may go now. So I trust his professionalism as a doctor.\n\nHowever after I collected 5 types of medication, I realised that it was only for flu related.\nSo I head back again and asked where is the lips allergy medicine.\n\nThe counter staff at first just said the medicine for inflammation also can help. Am in the puzzle how could a throat inflammation medication can help with lips allergy issue. Maybe it can but there is no explanation from the doctor so I have doubts.\n\nThen doctor in the room telling them to give me a Lip Balm. I show the staff I already have a lip balm and I don‚Äôt need another one. I need cure.\n\nEnd up they gave me allergy medicine. Before hand it over to me still asked me do you want it?\n\nI kind of disappointed with this whole process and yet you are feeling sick!\n\nLastly, what is the ethics to become a doctor? Don‚Äôt you all wanna help patients? But the feeling they gave me is just for the sake of money.\n\nSincerely.",

Can you please prescribe properly? Write the drug name and indication clearly . Not just simply said how many tablet to take . Very dangerous if patient simply ate wrongly\n\n3. With a 5min consultation and a bunch of unnecessary medicine, it cost freaking RM200! Walaweh owner rich sia sleep with money ady . You should include in details how much each medicine cost and not just simply write total amount to be paid only! Lousy\n\n4. Pity those patient who really need proper and optimal care .

I thought we can only  do check-up appointment through my sejahtera and wanted to ask for reschedule(they cannot done it for you,need to according to my sejahtera)but it turns out the appointment is for check-up AND directly filling or scaling. If you wanted to have a basic check-up or urgent tooth extraction they can just do it for you immediately.\nA very good service compared to UTC last time, since I need to wait around 30 minutes for the nurse that taking care of the counter to come out JUST to explain to me about their latest system (my sejahtera) I can't even get a BASIC check-up. The worse part is while waiting I can hear clearly that the nurses are laughing and chitchatting inside even though her colleagues had told her the arrival of the patient!",

Most of all, his drilling or filling or scaling, he will alert if there is a slight pain. No fear to have it done often. Moreover, the fees are reasonable compared to his knowledge and skills! Another thing is if you don't go for washing or scaling, in the long run will cause gum problems and will cause you very bad health. (The teeth poison do affect us).

I called up many clinics and all were fully booked except for this.\n\nI did scaling, polish, and filing of one decayed tooth.\n\nScaling was ok.\n\nPolish was painful as they used jets of water to blast away the stain. Imagine using water gun on the soft tissue in your mouth.\n\nFiling took a long time even though it was only one tooth. The procedure was very uncomfortable.\n\nWhole procedure took more than 40minutes and RM150 for scaling and RM150 for filing.\n\nNormally in other clinics I pay RM100 for scaling and RM80 for filing and only 10min or so.",
