From my experience, they are only one room and one Dr for patients to do their treatments and there are usually a lot of people queueing even though I have made an appointment.  People just go in and out after one another for their treatment in that room. Guess what. Obviously, the tools are not even cleaned as they should be because they have no time to clean those and sterilize them for the next person. When I agreed to do my braces there, the Dr straight away do the mold and ask to come to do 4 extractions on the next appointment. WITHOUT any X-TRAY, clear consultation, and observation. 4 extraction in one go is an absolutely insane recommendation. A person recommended this clinic because it is the cheapest in Kuching but tbh the worst you can ever imagine. I am so sorry for this and hope this clinic can improve on their hygiene and professionality. I changed my mind before it is too late and did not want to come to this clinic ever again.",

Then kept commenting me wasting time asking? HELLO!!..I paid for your expensive service not free OK!!U only interested in earning quantity and not do a quality work!U purposely rushed a lousy job and when I asked to smooth out the very rough filling,u got very angry for doing what any dentist should do. Then when I asked if my floss can go through you got super annoyed furious too.Then when I highlighted about u being so upright impatient and rude, u tried to turn the blame on me being disrespectful and gangsterly tried blocking me exit.Respect is to be earn and from beginning u have zero patience and totally rude sarcastic.U shouted GET OUT of your office when I feedback those honestly, seriously??As if I don't have enough of your stupid attitude?  So if anyone who need to ask about treatment with this sharlene do think again!!!She will start blow huge gas from the moment u ask, give that stuck up impatient facial expression and exploded.",

The doctor was very helpful, friendly, and gentle while checking my teeth — I felt really comfortable throughout the session.\n\nThe staff were also super kind and welcoming. Honestly, coming from my area, it’s quite rare for people to find this clinic because there are already so many other clinics nearby. But I decided to give this one a try even though it’s over 30 minutes away — and I’m really glad I did.\n\nI didn’t get the chance to fix my broken tooth here since my mom had already booked an appointment at another clinic without my knowing. I only had a check-up, an X-ray, and got some medicine, but they followed up the next day to ask how I was feeling after taking the medication. That kind of care is really appreciated.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you’re looking for a gentle and kind dental team.",

        "text": "I don’t usually like leaving bad reviews, but feel it’s important to share this experience.\n\nThe young male dentist used a sharp tool to lift my upper lip by stabbing the area behind my philtrum (near my upper frenulum). He did this to lift my upper lip out of the way to work on my upper teeth. Apart from applying quite a lot of force, he also held it in place for quite a while.\n\nTwo days later, this area is still sore. I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt, trusting his approach, though it was rather painful when my upper lip was held in place by the sharp object.\n\nMy teeth now feel unusually sensitive, especially with cold drinks, an issue I’ve never really had before. His handling was rough; the scaling was uncomfortable.\n\nLike a previous reviewer mentioned about short service times, he only spent 15 minutes on scaling and polishing. My appointment was at 4 p.m., and he appeared rushed, leaving about 10 minutes after finishing, before I even had time to make payment while waiting in the foyer.\n\nI’ve had positive experiences with other dentists here, including a female dentist who was attentive and quite gentle in her approach. The front desk staff is friendly, and I appreciated the reminders for my appointment.\n\nHowever, after this experience, I’ll be looking for a new clinic. I will now have to consult another clinic to ensure my teeth are ok, and the area behind my upper lip isn’t at risk of infection, as the stabbing was quite deep, it’s still sore, and my teeth are very sensitive right now.",

However, a visit to Wise Dental Clinic changed that perception completely. I did a full porcelain crown and the experience was 100% positive - it was completely pain free! 🙌 Dr Keith is an empathetic and caring dentist. He checked on me throughout the procedure, ensuring that I was ok. Though young, his skill, control and knowledge shows his deep understanding and passion for his vocation. Even the support staff from the receptionist to the dental nurses are well trained, caring and friendly. Teck-wise, Wise Dental seem to have it all - the latest gadgets and machines. From the reception's warm interior, to the bite block & red-tinted glasses, all of these offered a nice level of comfort for their patients. I am glad I took a leap of faith to try them out. It's been a month and my new crown feels like second nature. If you do give them a try, do wear something thicker because it can get quite cold sitting in the dental chair. Thanks Wise Dental!",
