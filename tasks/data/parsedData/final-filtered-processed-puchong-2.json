I visited because of tooth sensitivity in my molars and went for a checkup. When I explained my issue, the dentist looked at me with a concern and r u dxmb look, asking if I knew everyone is born with uneven teeth. I felt uncomfortable and regretted my decision.\n\nShe then forced me to look in the mirror, aggressively pointing out dirt deposits with an unfriendly tone, saying, \"Look! Only then you'll know what the problem is!\" After the checkup, she left me alone without saying anything. I walked out feeling uncertain and confused. While I appreciate the free service, I would rather pay for a more respectful and better experience somewhere else.",

The team is professional, friendly, and truly committed to patient care.\n\nI did my Invisalign treatment with Dr. Chong, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the results. Dr. Chong was thorough, patient, and always took the time to explain each step of the process. The aligners were comfortable and the progress was smooth‚Äîthanks to her clear guidance and attention to detail.\n\nDr. Wong handled my dental scaling. The procedure was gentle yet effective, and she made sure I was comfortable the entire time. Her approach was very reassuring, and my teeth have never felt cleaner.\n\nI also underwent gum surgery with Dr. Damon, which I was initially nervous about. However, Dr. Damon was incredibly skilled and professional. He walked me through the procedure, made sure I was at ease, and the post-surgery recovery was much better than expected.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Icon Dental Kinrara for anyone looking for quality dental care. Each of the doctors I saw were excellent in their own specialties, and the clinic environment is clean, modern, and welcoming.",

I also loved that he gave me a mirror to see the before-and-after results (not all clinics do that) and it was such a nice touch. On top of that, they gave me a free gift without asking me to leave a Google review first, unlike my previous clinic, which I really appreciated.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this clinic and will be coming back for sure!

Unlike other clinics where the first patient is usually seen promptly to reduce waiting time for others, this clinic took a different approach. They spoke to me politely and explained that they needed to complete their cleaning and sanitation routine before attending to any patients.\n\nThis extra time is critical, especially for a dental clinic, where hygiene directly impacts patient safety and care standards. It showed their commitment to maintaining a sterile environment and following proper protocols. Rather than rushing, they prioritized cleanliness and professionalism. It gave me confidence in their practices.\n\nWhat surprised me even more was seeing the lady at the reception helping with the cleaning. She didn‚Äôt just sit behind the desk ‚Äî she actively contributed to preparing the clinic. It showed teamwork and a shared sense of responsibility. That level of dedication was both rare and impressive. It made a strong first impression.\n\nNext, the dental doctor ‚Äî truly, no words can describe the experience. Calm and patient, the doctor took the time to explain every step in detail. Even though I was slow to understand at times, there was no rush or frustration. Instead, the doctor ensured I was comfortable and fully aware of what was happening.\n\nIt‚Äôs rare to come across a professional so dedicated to communication and patient care. The clarity and reassurance I received made a huge difference. I felt respected and valued as a patient. What could have been an anxious visit turned into a calm and educational experience. This kind of approach builds trust instantly. What an experience ‚Äî truly outstanding.",

Yet, from the moment I stepped in, everything felt surprisingly calm, almost as if I was exactly where I was meant to be.\n\nBy a stroke of luck, I found myself under the care of Dr. Neoh Ein Yau.\nA wonderful soul‚Äîcalm, gentle, and deeply professional. His soft voice, steady hands, and reassuring smile washed away every ounce of fear. He didn‚Äôt just treat a tooth; he treated a human being‚Äîwith dignity, patience, and heart. For that, I am profoundly grateful.\n\nThanks to the sophisticated equipment and Dr. Neoh‚Äôs vast experience, the procedure unfolded with incredible smoothness and comfort.\nThere was no struggle, no discomfort‚Äîonly a quiet confidence in the air, like a symphony played by a master. In that peaceful half-hour, my mind drifted elsewhere.\n\nAs I lay silently in the chair, memories of my late mother rose within me like a soft, unspoken prayer.\n‚ÄúNaren, please brush your teeth before you sleep,‚Äù she would say with a smile, night after night.\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat sweets‚Äîthey will spoil your teeth,‚Äù she would remind me, her voice filled with a tenderness only a mother can give.\nThose simple words, once brushed aside by my youthful stubbornness, now echoed louder than ever in my heart. In that moment, her love wrapped around me like an invisible blanket.\n\nA mother‚Äôs love never dies.\nIt lingers quietly‚Äîin our small habits, in fleeting thoughts, in the spaces between heartbeats. She gave so much, asked for so little, and loved without conditions. Years later, her gentle spirit still walks beside me, unseen but deeply felt‚Äîlike a hand resting lightly on my shoulder.\nWhat once felt like mere reminders now feel like sacred truths.\nIn that quiet chair, I realized: love like hers never leaves you. It becomes part of who you are.\n\nSo often we think we know better‚Äîwe ignore their words, thinking we‚Äôll figure it out ourselves.\nBut life has a way of circling back, teaching us with gentleness and sometimes with tears, that mothers always knew best.\n\nReturning to the present, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how special 32T Dental was.\nEvery staff member, from the front desk to the nurses, carried themselves with such grace and warmth.\nThey didn‚Äôt just provide a service‚Äîthey gave comfort, kindness, and care, in a world that often forgets how badly we all need them.\n\nDr. Neoh Ein Yau, though perhaps 15 years my junior, treated me with a reverence usually reserved for someone‚Äôs father.\nHis voice was soft, his words full of respect. His kindness was never hurried, never mechanical‚Äîit was sincere and effortless.\nHe explained every step with the patience of someone who truly understood human fears.\nThere was a quiet dignity in the way he worked, a rare and beautiful thing in today‚Äôs fast-paced world.\nIn that moment, age, titles, roles‚Äînone of it mattered. What mattered was the connection between two human beings, built on respect and compassion.\n\nIt is extraordinary how a simple dental visit turned into a profound life moment.\nNot pain, but peace.\nNot fear, but reflection.\nNot discomfort, but overwhelming gratitude.\n\nTo Dr. Neoh, his wonderful team at 32T Dental, and above all, to the enduring, everlasting love of my late mother‚Äî\nThank you. Thank you from the depths of a heart that will never forget.\n\n32T Dental Clinic\nAddress: Jalan Merbah 3, Bandar Puchong Jaya, 47100 Puchong, Selangor, Malaysia\nPhone: 012-920 2886\nWebsite: www.32tdental.com.my",
