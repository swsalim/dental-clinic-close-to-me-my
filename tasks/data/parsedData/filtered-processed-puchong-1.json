Environment is ambience and comfortable, but I was so lucky can go inside without waiting and was attended by Dr. Foo. Her appearance looks young around 30 I guess, but age doesn't matter the importance is the skills and experience. She performed a root canal treatment with great care and sometimes making joke at least reduce my tension and slowly I'm confident to her professional\nShe explained the procedure thoroughly. During my second visit, she spent one and a half hours carefully ensuring my tooth was in perfect condition, leaving no room for error. I look forward to my next appointment with her next week",
