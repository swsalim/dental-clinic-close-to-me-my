Dr. Tay is so so patient with my boy and waited for him to relax before checking his teeth. Bribery was involved, but I'm a fan of whatever works! My toddler has a fear of dentists and isn't easy to work with but Dr. Tay was incredibly compassionate dealing with the tantrums and managed to take a good look at his teeth. He's so good with kids.
