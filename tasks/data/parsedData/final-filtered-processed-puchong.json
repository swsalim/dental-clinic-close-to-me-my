While I appreciated the friendliness and professionalism of the front desk staff, the consultation itself was disappointing. The doctor appeared indecisive and did not offer any clear professional advice or direction. Instead of guiding me with confidence, he listed out several vague treatment options without recommending one based on medical reasoning or expertise, even when I specifically asked for his opinion.\n\nWhat was more frustrating was that the diagnosis I received turned out to be incorrect. I was told the issue was with my tooth and that extraction should be considered. However, I later visited another clinic for a second opinion, where the dentist quickly identified the actual cause of the discomfort, a minor gum issue due to something being lodged in the gum area. The issue was resolved without any invasive procedures, and there was no need to remove the tooth at all.\n\nIt felt as though the doctor‚Äôs default response was to suggest extraction rather than thoroughly diagnosing the root cause of my symptoms. This approach gave me little confidence in the clinic‚Äôs ability to provide accurate, solution-based care. For patients who already know exactly what they want done, Lumiere might be sufficient. But for anyone looking for professional advice or proper diagnosis, I would strongly recommend seeking a more experienced opinion elsewhere.\n\nThis experience left me frustrated and disappointed. I hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and works to improve its diagnostic process and communication between doctors and patients.\n\nTLDR:  a waste of my time and energy",
