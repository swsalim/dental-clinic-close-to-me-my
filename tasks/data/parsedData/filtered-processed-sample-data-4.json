Dr. Tay is so so patient with my boy and waited for him to relax before checking his teeth. Bribery was involved, but I'm a fan of whatever works! My toddler has a fear of dentists and isn't easy to work with but Dr. Tay was incredibly compassionate dealing with the tantrums and managed to take a good look at his teeth. He's so good with kids. I'm so grateful for his patience.\n\nFacility is very new and clean and everyone was super friendly. Parking was super easy too! Great experience overall!",
