Dr. Tay is so so patient with my boy and waited for him to relax before checking his teeth. Bribery was involved, but I'm a fan of whatever works! My toddler has a fear of dentists and isn't easy to work with but Dr. Tay was incredibly compassionate dealing with the tantrums and managed to take a good look at his teeth. He's so good with kids. I'm so grateful for his patience.\n\nFacility is very new and clean and everyone was super friendly. Parking was super easy too! Great experience overall!",

The whole process is like rushing me off saying no issue with my condition for flu & my lips.\n\nWhen I shared with the doctor am having some lips allergy, he said he can see the redness but never ask for how long this start to happen (am having lips eczema for a while) and just replied will give me some medicine so not to worry.\n\nI have no chance to continue cause he said is done. You may go now. So I trust his professionalism as a doctor.\n\nHowever after I collected 5 types of medication, I realised that it was only for flu related.\nSo I head back again and asked where is the lips allergy medicine.\n\nThe counter staff at first just said the medicine for inflammation also can help. Am in the puzzle how could a throat inflammation medication can help with lips allergy issue. Maybe it can but there is no explanation from the doctor so I have doubts.\n\nThen doctor in the room telling them to give me a Lip Balm. I show the staff I already have a lip balm and I don‚Äôt need another one. I need cure.\n\nEnd up they gave me allergy medicine. Before hand it over to me still asked me do you want it?\n\nI kind of disappointed with this whole process and yet you are feeling sick!\n\nLastly, what is the ethics to become a doctor? Don‚Äôt you all wanna help patients? But the feeling they gave me is just for the sake of money.\n\nSincerely.",

If a doctor dont listen to patient , it is a total failure . He also seems too rushing , probably unable to handle a busy clinic alone .\n\n2. Drug dispensers are the worst . Can you please prescribe properly? Write the drug name and indication clearly . Not just simply said how many tablet to take . Very dangerous if patient simply ate wrongly\n\n3. With a 5min consultation and a bunch of unnecessary medicine, it cost freaking RM200! Walaweh owner rich sia sleep with money ady . You should include in details how much each medicine cost and not just simply write total amount to be paid only! Lousy\n\n4. Pity those patient who really need proper and optimal care . Just avoid this clinic and save your money . Thanks !",

I thought we can only  do check-up appointment through my sejahtera and wanted to ask for reschedule(they cannot done it for you,need to according to my sejahtera)but it turns out the appointment is for check-up AND directly filling or scaling. If you wanted to have a basic check-up or urgent tooth extraction they can just do it for you immediately.\nA very good service compared to UTC last time, since I need to wait around 30 minutes for the nurse that taking care of the counter to come out JUST to explain to me about their latest system (my sejahtera) I can't even get a BASIC check-up. The worse part is while waiting I can hear clearly that the nurses are laughing and chitchatting inside even though her colleagues had told her the arrival of the patient!",

Another thing is if you don't go for washing or scaling, in the long run will cause gum problems and will cause you very bad health. (The teeth poison do affect us). We all like to recommend Dr Anthony Bong to anyone around us here.",

I called up many clinics and all were fully booked except for this.\n\nI did scaling, polish, and filing of one decayed tooth.\n\nScaling was ok.\n\nPolish was painful as they used jets of water to blast away the stain. Imagine using water gun on the soft tissue in your mouth.\n\nFiling took a long time even though it was only one tooth. The procedure was very uncomfortable.\n\nWhole procedure took more than 40minutes and RM150 for scaling and RM150 for filing.\n\nNormally in other clinics I pay RM100 for scaling and RM80 for filing and only 10min or so.",

From my experience, they are only one room and one Dr for patients to do their treatments and there are usually a lot of people queueing even though I have made an appointment.  People just go in and out after one another for their treatment in that room. Guess what. Obviously, the tools are not even cleaned as they should be because they have no time to clean those and sterilize them for the next person. When I agreed to do my braces there, the Dr straight away do the mold and ask to come to do 4 extractions on the next appointment. WITHOUT any X-TRAY, clear consultation, and observation. 4 extraction in one go is an absolutely insane recommendation. A person recommended this clinic because it is the cheapest in Kuching but tbh the worst you can ever imagine. I am so sorry for this and hope this clinic can improve on their hygiene and professionality. I changed my mind before it is too late and did not want to come to this clinic ever again.",

From start to finish, everything was handled with great care and professionalism.\n\nThe hygienist was incredibly thorough yet gentle, making sure I was comfortable throughout the procedure. The scaling was meticulous, removing all the plaque and tartar without any discomfort. After the polishing, my teeth felt unbelievably smooth and looked noticeably brighter.\n\nWhat really stood out was the attention to detail and the genuine care the staff showed. They explained each step of the process, offered helpful tips for maintaining oral hygiene, and made sure I was completely satisfied with the results.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a clinic that takes cleaning seriously and leaves your teeth feeling fresh and spotless, I highly recommend D DENTIST DENTAL CLINIC (TABUAN JAYA). I‚Äôm already looking forward to my next visit!",

Likewise today I'm smiling and not embarrassed for any business zoom calls because of Doctor Nurul Amira.  I recommend this place for anyone looking  for a good Dentist and please visit Benchmark dental at Cityone mall at Kuching. Once again a big hooray to Benchmark.\n#doctornurulamira.",

Then kept commenting me wasting time asking?¬†HELLO!!..I paid for your expensive service not free OK!!U only interested in earning quantity and not do a quality work!U purposely rushed a lousy job and when I asked to smooth out the very rough filling,u got very angry for doing what any dentist should do. Then when I asked if my floss can go through you got super annoyed furious too.Then when I highlighted about u being so upright impatient and rude, u tried to turn the blame on me being disrespectful and gangsterly tried blocking me exit.Respect is to be earn and from beginning u have zero patience and totally rude sarcastic.U shouted GET OUT of your office when I feedback those honestly, seriously??As if I don't have enough of your stupid attitude?

The front desk staff was friendly and efficient with scheduling and insurance questions.\nDr Davina was thorough, gentle, professional, and skillful. She took the time to explain my treatment options and gave me the best advice for my dental treatment. I always used to be scared of dental treatments, but here I felt comfortable and at ease.\nThe clinic itself is clean, modern, and has a calming atmosphere. The clinic is also kids-friendly, with a slide for the children to enjoy.\nWait times were minimal, and I was seen right on schedule. They even sent a helpful follow-up text with care instructions afterward.\nOverall, I highly recommend this dental clinic for their professional service, caring approach, and state-of-the-art care. I‚Äôll definitely be returning for my future dental needs.",

The doctor was very helpful, friendly, and gentle while checking my teeth ‚Äî I felt really comfortable throughout the session.\n\nThe staff were also super kind and welcoming. Honestly, coming from my area, it‚Äôs quite rare for people to find this clinic because there are already so many other clinics nearby. But I decided to give this one a try even though it‚Äôs over 30 minutes away ‚Äî and I‚Äôm really glad I did.\n\nI didn‚Äôt get the chance to fix my broken tooth here since my mom had already booked an appointment at another clinic without my knowing. I only had a check-up, an X-ray, and got some medicine, but they followed up the next day to ask how I was feeling after taking the medication. That kind of care is really appreciated.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out if you‚Äôre looking for a gentle and kind dental team.",

Dr. Noraini handled my braces treatment and extractions with great skill, it was completely painless.. She is highly knowledgeable, professional, and someone you can truly trust with your dental care.

        "text": "I don‚Äôt usually like leaving bad reviews, but feel it‚Äôs important to share this experience.\n\nThe young male dentist used a sharp tool to lift my upper lip by stabbing the area behind my philtrum (near my upper frenulum). He did this to lift my upper lip out of the way to work on my upper teeth. Apart from applying quite a lot of force, he also held it in place for quite a while.\n\nTwo days later, this area is still sore. I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt, trusting his approach, though it was rather painful when my upper lip was held in place by the sharp object.\n\nMy teeth now feel unusually sensitive, especially with cold drinks, an issue I‚Äôve never really had before. His handling was rough; the scaling was uncomfortable.\n\nLike a previous reviewer mentioned about short service times, he only spent 15 minutes on scaling and polishing. My appointment was at 4 p.m., and he appeared rushed, leaving about 10 minutes after finishing, before I even had time to make payment while waiting in the foyer.\n\nI‚Äôve had positive experiences with other dentists here, including a female dentist who was attentive and quite gentle in her approach. The front desk staff is friendly, and I appreciated the reminders for my appointment.\n\nHowever, after this experience, I‚Äôll be looking for a new clinic. I will now have to consult another clinic to ensure my teeth are ok, and the area behind my upper lip isn‚Äôt at risk of infection, as the stabbing was quite deep, it‚Äôs still sore, and my teeth are very sensitive right now.",

I feel like I can just go home and brush my own teeth. Not bad, but it's just not for me.",

However, a visit to Wise Dental Clinic changed that perception completely. I did a full porcelain crown and the experience was 100% positive - it was completely pain free! üôå Dr Keith is an empathetic and caring dentist. He checked on me throughout the procedure, ensuring that I was ok. Though young, his skill, control and knowledge shows his deep understanding and passion for his vocation. Even the support staff from the receptionist to the dental nurses are well trained, caring and friendly. Teck-wise, Wise Dental seem to have it all - the latest gadgets and machines. From the reception's warm interior, to the bite block & red-tinted glasses, all of these offered a nice level of comfort for their patients. I am glad I took a leap of faith to try them out. It's been a month and my new crown feels like second nature. If you do give them a try, do wear something thicker because it can get quite cold sitting in the dental chair. Thanks Wise Dental!",
